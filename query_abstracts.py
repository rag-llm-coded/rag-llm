Academic Analytics is extracting hidden patterns from educational databases. The main goal of this area is to extract hidden patterns from student academic performances and behaviors. One of the main topics in academic analytics is to study the academic performance of freshman students. Students enrolled in first year are the most vulnerable to low student retention in higher education institution. Research studies from different Higher Educational Institutions already indicated that early identification of students with academic difficulty is very crucial in the development of intervention programs. As such, early identification of potential leavers and successful intervention program(s) are the keys for improving student retention. The study will utilize the available enrollment and admission data. Feature selection technique will be used to determine significant attributes. The study aims to produce predictive and cluster model in which can early identify students who are in need of academic help and program interventions. The extracted predictive and cluster models will be evaluated using confusion matrix and be integrated in the decision support application.
Academic database is considered as the heart and soul of every higher education institutions. This database contains a vast amount of useful information that is useful for analysis. Algorithms for machine learning play a significant role in mining academic databases and have been proven to be effective when applied in the academic field. Prediction models are made using relevant classification algorithms for dropout analysis. The success of the prediction model depends on the performance of the feature selection algorithm used for dimensionality reduction. The study utilized the Modified Mutated Firefly Algorithm (MMFA) as a dimensionality reduction strategy to enhance the accuracy of the prediction model for dropout analysis. The results of the simulation revealed that the Decision Tree (DT) classifier outperformed the Naïve Bayesian using the three UCI datasets. After the test of benchmark datasets, a students'' cumulative dataset was used to come up with a predictive model for dropout analysis of Davao del Norte State College, Davao del Norte, Philippines. The results of the experiment confirmed that the MMFA+DT obtained an accuracy rate of 95.82%, while MMFA+NB only has 92.85% using 10-fold cross-validation.
Among the many open problems in the learning process, students dropout is one of the most complicated and negative ones, both for the student and the institutions, and being able to predict it could help to alleviate its social and economic costs. To address this problem we developed a tool that, by exploiting machine learning techniques, allows to predict the dropout of a first-year undergraduate student. The proposed tool allows to estimate the risk of quitting an academic course, and it can be used either during the application phase or during the first year, since it selectively accounts for personal data, academic records from secondary school and also first year course credits. Our experiments have been performed by considering real data of students from eleven schools of a major University.
Automated prediction of students'' retention and graduation in education using advanced analytical methods such as artificial intelligence (AI), has recently attracted the attention of educators, both in theory and in practice. Whereas invaluable insights and theories for measuring and testing the topic have been proposed, most of the existing methods do not technically highlight the non-trivial factors behind the renowned challenges and attrition. To this effect, by making use of two categories of data collected in a higher education setting about students (i) retention (n = 52262) and (ii) graduation (n = 53639); this study proposes a machine learning model - RG-DMML (retention and graduation data mining and machine learning) and ensemble algorithm for prediction of students'' retention and graduation status in education. This was done by training and testing key features that are technically deemed suitable for measuring the constructs (retention and graduation), such as (i) the Average grade of the previous high school, and (ii) the Entry/admission score. The proposed model (RG-DMML) is designed based on the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, implemented using supervised machine learning technique such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and validated using the k-fold cross-validation method. The results show that the executed model and algorithm based on the Bagging method and 10-fold cross-validation are efficient and effective for predicting the student''s retention and graduation status, with Precision (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.822), Recall (retention = 1.000, graduation = 0.957), Accuracy (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.817), F1-Score (retention = 0.952, graduation = 0.885) showing significant high accuracy levels or performance rate, and low Error-rate (retention = 0.090, graduation = 0.182), respectively. In addition, by considering the individual features selected through the Wrapper method in predicting the outputs, the proposed model proved more effective for predicting the students'' retention status in comparison to the graduation data. The implications of the models'' output and factors that impact the effective prediction or identification of at-risk students, e.g., for timely intervention, counselling, decision-making, and sustainable educational practice are empirically discussed in the study.
Background: Across higher education, student retention, progression, and graduation are considered essential elements of students’ academic success. However, there is scarce literature analyzing these attributes across health professions education. The current study aims to explore rates of student retention, progression, and graduation across five colleges of the Health Cluster at Qatar University, and identify predictive factors. Methods: Secondary longitudinal data for students enrolled at the Health Cluster between 2015 and 2021 were subject to descriptive statistics to obtain retention, progression and graduation rates. The importance of student demographic and academic variables in predicting retention, progression, or graduation was determined by a predictive model using XGBoost, after preparation and feature engineering. A predictive model was constructed, in which weak decision tree models were combined to capture the relationships between the initial predictors and student outcomes. A feature importance score for each predictor was estimated; features that had higher scores were indicative of higher influence on student retention, progression, or graduation. Results: A total of 88% of the studied cohorts were female Qatari students. The rates of retention and progression across the studied period showed variable distribution, and the majority of students graduated from health colleges within a timeframe of 4–7 years. The first academic year performance, followed by high school GPA, were factors that respectively ranked first and second in importance in predicting retention, progression, and graduation of health majors students. The health college ranked third in importance affecting retention and graduation and fifth regarding progression. The remaining factors including nationality, gender, and whether students were enrolled in a common first year experience for all colleges, had lower predictive importance. Conclusions: Student retention, progression, and graduation at Qatar University Health Cluster is complex and multifactorial. First year performance and secondary education before college are important in predicting progress in health majors after the first year of university study. Efforts to increase retention, progression, and graduation rates should include academic advising, student support, engagement and communication. Machine learning-based predictive algorithms remain a useful tool that can be precisely leveraged to identify key variables affecting health professions students’ performance.
Background: Despite powerful efforts to maximize nursing school enrollment, schools and colleges of nursing are faced with high rates of attrition and low rates of completion. Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80% of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90% after the second college year and 99% after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services.
Based on the advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence, there is still a room for enhancement of student university retention. The main objective of this study is to assess the probability of using Artificial Intelligence techniques such as deep and machine learning procedures to predict university student retention. In this study a variable assessment is carried out on the dataset which was collected from Kaggle repository. The performance of twenty supervised algorithms of machine learning and one algorithm of deep learning is assessed. All algorithms were trained using 10 variables from 1100 records of former university student registrations that have been registered in the University. The top performing algorithm after hyper-parameters tuning was NuSVC Classifier. Therefore, we were able to use the current dataset to create supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predicting student retention with F1-score (90.32 percent) for ML and the proposed DL algorithm with F1-score (93.05 percent).
Beyond managing student dropout, higher education stakeholders need decision support to consistently influence the student learning process to keep students motivated, engaged, and successful. At the course level, the combination of predictive analytics and self-regulation theory can help instructors determine the best study advice and allow learners to better self-regulate and determine how they want to learn. The best performing techniques are often black-box models that favor performance over interpretability and are heavily influenced by course contexts. In this study, we argue that explainable AI has the potential not only to uncover the reasons behind model decisions, but also to reveal their stability across contexts, effectively bridging the gap between predictive and explanatory learning analytics (LA). In contributing to decision support systems research, this study (1) leverages traditional techniques, such as concept drift and performance drift, to investigate the stability of student success prediction models over time; (2) uses Shapley Additive explanations in a novel way to explore the stability of extracted feature importance rankings generated for these models; (3) generates new insights that emerge from stable features across cohorts, enabling teachers to determine study advice. We believe this study makes a strong contribution to education research at large and expands the field of LA by augmenting the interpretability and explainability of prediction algorithms and ensuring their applicability in changing contexts.
Brazilian society suffers constant financial losses when higher education students disassociate from universities without completing the degree program in which they were enrolled. This is especially true when the institutions are funded through public resources. In order to minimize evasion losses, socioeconomic policies and programs were created to assist and support actions seeking to maximize the number of students that graduate in a suitable program time. This work presents a methodology that aims to predict evasion by using machine learning. Our approach was able to classify student abandonment with an average f-score and accuracy results above 95%. Our approach combines a decision tree alongside a genetic algorithm and cluster stratified sampling. The results obtained show that students with a Grade Point Average (GPA) below 5.79 and that have been enrolled for more than a year require careful monitoring because they tend to exceed the program duration time or abandon it. Furthermore, approximately one-third of all identified dropouts students occurred in the first year.
College attrition is a chronic problem for institutions of higher education. In Brazilian public universities, attrition also accounts for the significant waste of public resources desperately needed in other sectors of society. Thus, given the severity and persistence of this problem, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to mitigate undergraduate dropout rates. Using H2O software as a data mining tool, our study employed parameter tuning to train 321 of three classification algorithms, and with Deep Learning, it was possible to predict 71.1% of the cases of dropout given these characteristics. With this result, it will be possible to identify the attrition profiles of students and implement corrective measures on initiating their studies.
College context and academic performance are important determinants of academic success; using students’ prior experience with machine learning techniques to predict academic success before the end of the first year reinforces college self-efficacy. Dropout prediction is related to student retention and has been studied extensively in recent work; however, there is little literature on predicting academic success using educational machine learning. For this reason, CRISP-DM methodology was applied to extract relevant knowledge and features from the data. The dataset examined consists of 6690 records and 21 variables with academic and socioeconomic information. Preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms were analyzed. The area under the curve was used to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm; XGBoost had an AUC = 87.75% and correctly classified eight out of ten cases, while the decision tree improved interpretation with ten rules in seven out of ten cases. Recognizing the gaps in the study and that on-time completion of college consolidates college self-efficacy, creating intervention and support strategies to retain students is a priority for decision makers. Assessing the fairness and discrimination of the algorithms was the main limitation of this work. In the future, we intend to apply the extracted knowledge and learn about its influence of on university management.
Colleges and universities are increasingly interested in tracking student progress as they monitor and work to improve their retention and graduation rates. Ideally, early indicators of student progress, or lack thereof, can be used to provide appropriate interventions that increase the likelihood of student success. In this paper we present a framework that uses machine learning, and in particular, a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), to predict the performance of students early in their academic careers. The results obtained show that the proposed framework can predict student progress, specifically student grade point average (GPA) within the intended major, with minimal error after observing a single semester of performance. Furthermore, as additional performance is observed, the predicted GPA in subsequent semesters becomes increasingly accurate, providing the ability to advise students regarding likely success outcomes early in their academic careers.
Computer science (CS) enrollments are at an all-time high, [1] and successful undergraduate CS graduations are indisputably important. With a student population of approximately 51,000, Georgia State University is a USA based state university which is diverse and forms a rich big data footprint as students navigate pathways to graduation. Quoted in a July 2017 article from HigherEd.com, Georgia State''s extensive predictive analytics efforts are leading to better grades and student retention - and more minorities graduating from STEM programs. This doctoral project builds upon current data mining and modeling, machine learning applications, and learning analytics for predicting student success that is beyond retention. Gaining knowledge of CS student learning, developing better alerting models for success, and discovering behavioral indicators from learning analytics reporting is the goal of this research. Using this knowledge as evidence based data for improving the CS student experience will aid in performance improvements and increase pathways to graduation. My supporting research project is building CS student datasets to represent the student as directed graphical models, investigating their relationships using machine learning frameworks, and complex mathematical computations (tensors or gradient boosting) along with graph data mining techniques.
Context: School dropout is a significant challenge for the Brazilian education system. Several factors need to be corrected, and others eliminated so that students can to have access to higher education and guarantee the completion of their courses. Motivation: finding the best model to predict a specific problem is not a simple task. It''s because the phenomena involved are not known, or are sophisticated modeling. Thus, combining models often produces better accuracy than individual models. Different models use this combination approach and have been applied in the context of Data Mining (MD), for prediction and classification. Objective: we propose in this study three different models to predict school dropout. These are based on Ensemble Regression. We apply the models in the context of the Brazilian Higher Education Institutions. Besides, it may help in the identification of the factors associated with dropout. For this, we used two techniques for the attribute selection: Stepwise and Pearson correlation. That techniques determine the factors related to dropout. Methodology: we used the data from the Census and Flow Indicators Higher Education. The methodology is based on CRISP-DM to understand, prepare, and model the data. We used predictive bagging methods to make a model to predict dropout. Results: the ensemble regression models proposed obtained better performance compared model literature. The ensemble model based on bagging of linear regression had a smaller prediction error. Besides, the models proposed in this study will help the educational administrators and policymakers working within the educational sector in the development of new policies that are relevant to student retention. But, the global implications of this research to practice is its ability to help in early identifying factories associated with students at risk of dropout of High Education.
Context: The student dropout in Higher Education contributes to much social, economic, and academic loss. Students have different reasons for dropping out but the main ones are related to difficulty in learning the content, the structure proposed by the course, and the lack of financial resources. Problem: Besides understanding the motive for students completely abandoned their studies, the most important problem is identifying which groups of students are at risk of dropping out. However, studies focus essentially on categorical indicators, i.e., binary results that denote whether a student is or is not in the risk group. This type of analysis is important, but, it does not present the variation in the student’s performance during their academic life. Solution: Creating a score using machine learning techniques (KNN) can provide an instrument to measure how close the student is or not to the dropout group. Theory: We used Organizational knowledge creation to make available and expand knowledge about dropping and to provide inputs for the creation of a knowledge system. Method: The experimental study is quantitative and it was performed from the execution of KNN and its validation from statistical analyses. Results: With equation developed and accuracy of 87% with KNN, was possible to develop a drop out risk score with values between 0 and 1,000, where the closer to 0, the greater the probability of the student to drop out. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The main contribution of the paper is to provide a new method to assist in the analysis of higher education dropout in Information System and other courses.
Currently, one of the challenges of educational institutions is drop-out student issues. Several factors have been found and determined potentially capable to stimulate dropouts. Many researchers have been applied data mining methods to analyze, predict dropout students and also optimize finding dropout variables in advance. The main objective of this study is to find the best modeling solution in identifying dropout student predictors from 17432 student data of a private university in Jakarta. We also analyze and measure the correlation between demographic indicators and academic performance to predict student dropout using three single classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). We found indicators such as student’s attendance, homework-grade, mid-test grade, and finals-test grade, total credit, GPA, student''s area, parent''s income, parent’s education level, gender and age as student’s dropout predictors. The results only get 64.29 (NB), 64.84% (DT), and 75.27%(KNN) while we tried to combine algorithms with Ensemble Classifier Methods using Gradient Boosting as meta-classifier and gets better about 79.12%. In addition, we also get the best accuracy of about 98.82% using this method which was tested by 10-fold cross-validation.
Data mining combines machine learning, statistics and visualization techniques to discover and extract knowledge. One of the biggest challenges that higher education faces is to improve student retention (National Audition Office, 2007). Student retention has become an indication of academic performance and enrolment management. Our project uses data mining and natural language processing technologies to monitor student, analyze student academic behaviour and provide a basis for efficient intervention strategies. Our aim is to identify potential problems as early as possible and to follow up with intervention options to enhance student retention. In this paper we discuss how data mining can help spot students ''at risk'', evaluate the course or module suitability, and tailor the interventions to increase student retention.
Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from a huge amount of data. One of the most common applications of data mining is the use of different algorithms and tools to estimate future events based on previous experiences. In this context, many researchers have been using data mining techniques to support and solve challenges in higher education. There are many challenges facing this level of education, one of which is helping students to choose the right course to improve their success rate. An early prediction of students’ grades may help to solve this problem and improve students’ performance, selection of courses, success rate and retention. In this paper we use different classification techniques in order to build a performance prediction model, which is based on previous students’ academic records. The model can be easily integrated into a recommender system that can help students in their course selection, based on their and other graduated students’ grades. Our model uses two of the most recognised decision tree classification algorithms: ID3 and J48. The advantages of such a system have been presented along with a comparison in performance between the two algorithms.
Decreasing student attrition rates is one of the main objectives of most higher education institutions. However, to achieve this goal, universities need to accurately identify and focus their efforts on students most likely to quit their studies before they graduate. This has given rise to a need to implement forecasting models to predict which students will eventually drop out. In this paper, we present an early warning system to automatically identify first-semester students at high risk of dropping out. The system is based on a machine learning model trained from historical data on first-semester students. The results show that the system can predict “at-risk” students with a sensitivity of 61.97%, which allows early intervention for those students, thereby reducing the student attrition rate.
Development has been seen in the advanced education segment in South Africa. With this development, an expansion in the dropout rate is noticed. This study explores the adequacy of dimensional decrease and concentrates the significant data covered up in the student information for the identification of students in danger of dropout. This study depends on educational data mining techniques and makes forecasts of dropout goal of understudies from courses. In the test, the researchers show promising outcomes with information from the recognition courses of a University of Technology.
Different sectors have sought to take advantage of opportunities to invest in big data analytics and Natural language processing, in order to improve their productivity and competitiveness. Current challenges facing the higher education sector include a rapidly changing and evolving environment, which necessitates the development of new ways of thinking. Interest has therefore increased in analytics as part of the solution to many issues in higher education, including rate of student attrition and learner support. This study provides a comprehensive discussion on big data, learning analytics and use of NLP in higher education. In addition, it introduces an integrated learning analytics solution leveraging a distributed technology system capable of supporting academic authorities and advisors at educational institutions in making decisions concerning individual students.
Dropout rate in Bangladeshi universities getting high day by day. Especially in engineering subjects. Massive number of students taking various engineering subjects for their under graduation. However, the completion rate is low. There can be mainly two types of reasons behind dropout- Academic or personal reasons. The target of this study is to find the factors behind the high dropout rate in Bangladeshi universities engineering subjects and also to detect risky profiles for dropout so that their dropout can be prevented. Current and previous student''s data is analyzed to find the factors and students at the risk of dropout, which can be useful for developing new strategies in the education system by universities or other educational authorities. SVM, random forest, neural network, etc. were used for creating the prediction model.
Due to high failure rates many students end up spending unnecessary years struggling to qualify and subsequently accumulate unnecessary debt. In this paper, our principal contribution is to provide an expert system that statistically predicts the success of a first year student in an undergraduate Science programme given only academic merit in their subject matter. Over the past decades, much work has been done in the field of predicting student success in first year computer science and in other first year courses. Historically, other authors focused on using linear statistical models to predict student success. These models had limitations as the prediction was designed for inference as compared to machine learning techniques. This paper presents an approach of using the naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machines and decision trees as models that can be used to predict the completion of an undergraduate science degree. This was done by firstly training the classifiers and then testing them. The support vector machine achieved the best accuracy (87%) in predicting the completion of a science degree based only on first year marks, this was followed by the naïve Bayes model (86.36%) and the decision tree (65.62%) came last.
Each year, roughly 30% of first-year students at US baccalaureate institutions do not return for their second year and billions of dollars are spent educating these students. Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. What''s more, most of the previous attempts to model attrition at traditional campuses using machine learning have focused on small, homogeneous groups of students. In this work, we model student attrition using a dataset that is composed almost exclusively of information routinely collected for record-keeping at a large, public US university. By examining the entirety of the university''s student body and not a subset thereof, we use one of the largest known datasets for examining attrition at a public US university (N = 66,060). Our results show that students'' second year re-enrollment and eventual graduation can be accurately predicted based on a single year of data (AUROCs = 0.887 and 0.811, respectively). We find that demographic data (such as race, gender, etc.) and pre-admission data (such as high school academics, entrance exam scores, etc.) - upon which most admissions processes are predicated - are not nearly as useful as early college performance/transcript data for these predictions. These results highlight the potential for data mining to impact student retention and success at traditional campuses.
Early dropout of students is one of the bigger problems that universities face currently. Several machine learning techniques have been used for detecting students at risk of dropout. By using sociodemographic data and qualifications of the previous level, the accuracy of these predictive models is good enough for implementing retention programs. In addition, by using grades of the first semesters, the accuracy of these models increases. Nevertheless, the classification errors produced by these models cause undetected students to be discarded from the retention programs, whereas students with no actual risk consume additional resources. In order to provide more accurate models, we propose the use of a stacking ensemble technique to obtain an improved combined dropout model, while using relatively few variables. The model results show values on the expected ranges for an early dropout model, but with considerably fewer features and historical information, and we show that deploying the models would be cost-efficient for the institution if applied towards an intervention program.
Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emergent discipline that concen-trates on the design of self-learning and adaptive approaches. Higher education institutions have started to utilize analytical tools to improve students’ grades and retention. Prediction of students’ performance is a difficult process owing to the massive quantity of educational data. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be used for educational data mining in a big data environ-ment. At the same time, in EDM, the feature selection process becomes necessary in creation of feature subsets. Since the feature selection performance affects the predictive performance of any model, it is important to elaborately investigate the outcome of students’ performance model related to the feature selection techni-ques. With this motivation, this paper presents a new Metaheuristic Optimiza-tion-based Feature Subset Selection with an Optimal Deep Learning model (MOFSS-ODL) for predicting students’ performance. In addition, the proposed model uses an isolation forest-based outlier detection approach to eliminate the existence of outliers. Besides, the Chaotic Monarch Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (CBOA) is used for the selection of highly related features with low complexity and high performance. Then, a sailfish optimizer with stacked sparse autoencoder (SFO-SSAE) approach is utilized for the classification of educational data. The MOFSS-ODL model is tested against a benchmark student’s performance data set from the UCI repository. A wide-ranging simulation analysis por-trayed the improved predictive performance of the MOFSS-ODL technique over recent approaches in terms of different measures. Compared to other methods, experimental results prove that the proposed (MOFSS-ODL) classification model does a great job of predicting students’ academic progress, with an accuracy of 96.49%.
Educational data mining is a research field that looks for extracting useful information from large educational datasets. This area provides tools for improving student retention rates around the world. In this paper we propose a computational approach using educational data mining and different supervised learning techniques (Decision Trees, K-nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Random Forests) to evaluate the behaviour of different prediction models in order to identify the profile of at-risk university students in a Brazilian university environment. The results of this paper indicate that some algorithms can be used as tools for supporting decisions that reduce school dropout.
Engineering students'' affective self-beliefs can be influential factors directly or indirectly affecting their academic success and career decision. This paper examines whether students'' non-cognitive factors can be used, alone or in combination with cognitive factors, in artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict engineering student''s future retention. Four ANN based retention prediction models using different combinations of non-cognitive and cognitive factors are presented. The independent variables includes survey items from nine non-cognitive constructs (leadership, deep learning, surface learning, teamwork, self-efficacy, motivation, meta-cognition, expectancy-value, and major decision) and eleven cognitive items representing student''s high school academic performance. The dependent variable (i.e., the output from these models) is the student''s retention status after one year. Data from more than 4900 first-year engineering students from three freshman cohorts (2004, 2005, 2006) in a large Midwestern university were collected and utilized in training and testing these ANN prediction models. Among the four ANN models developed, the model combining 11 cognitive items and 60 selected non-cognitive items has the highest overall prediction accuracy at 71.3%, probability of detection (POD) for retained students at 78.7% and POD for not retained student at 40.5%. Removing the 11 cognitive items from this model, the overall prediction accuracy would drop slightly to 70.5%. Results from training and testing the same model using student data from different cohorts indicate the ANN model''s predictive performance is generally stable across different cohort years. Also, a model trained with earlier year (2004) freshman cohort''s data has maintained its predictive power very well when tested with student data from later (2005 and 2006) cohorts.
Enrolment figures have been expanding in South African institutions of higher-learning, however, the expansion has not been accompanied by a proportional increase in the percentage of enrolled learners completing their degrees. In a recent undergraduate-cohort-studies report, the DHET highlight the low percentage of students completing their degrees in the allotted time, having remained between 25.7% and 32.2% for the academic years 2000 to 2017, that is, every year since 2000, more than 67% of the learners enrolled did not complete their degrees in minimum time. In this paper, we set up two prediction tasks aimed at the early-identification of learners that may need academic assistance in order to complete their studies in the allocated time. In the first task we employed six classification models to deduce a learner''s end-of-year outcome from the first year of registration until qualifying in a three-year degree. The classification task was a success, with Random Forests attaining top predictive accuracy at 95.45% classifying the “final outcome” variable. In the second task we attempt to predict the time it is most likely to take a student to complete their degree based on enrolment observations. We complete this task by employing six classifiers again to deduce the distribution over four risk profiles set up to represent the length of time taken to graduate. This phase of the study provided three main contributions to the current body of work: (1) an interactive program that can calculate the posterior probability over a student''s risk profile, (2) a comparison of the classifiers accuracy in deducing a learner''s risk profile, and (3) a ranking of the employed features according to their contribution in correctly classifying the risk profile variable. Random Forests attained the top accuracy in this phase of experiments as well, with an accuracy of 83%.
Featured Application: Application to student counseling and reducing the dropout rate in universities. Since a high dropout rate for university students is a significant risk to local communities and countries, a dropout prediction model using machine learning is an active research domain to prevent students from dropping out. However, it is challenging to fulfill the needs of consulting institutes and the office of academic affairs. To the consulting institute, the accuracy in the prediction is of the utmost importance; to the offices of academic affairs and other offices, the reason for dropping out is essential. This paper proposes a Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) system, a hybrid model to predict the students who are about to drop out of the university. The model tries to increase the dropout precision and the dropout recall rate in predicting the dropouts. We then analyzed the reason for dropping out by compressing the feature set with PCA and applying K-means clustering to the compressed feature set. The SDP system showed a precision value of 0.963, which is 0.093 higher than the highest-precision model of the existing works. The dropout recall and F1 scores, 0.766 and 0.808, respectively, were also better than those of gradient boosting by 0.117 and 0.011, making them the highest among the existing works; Then, we classified the reasons for dropping out into four categories: “Employed”, “Did Not Register”, “Personal Issue”, and “Admitted to Other University.” The dropout precision of “Admitted to Other University” was the highest, at 0.672. In post-verification, the SDP system increased counseling efficiency by accurately predicting dropouts with high dropout precision in the “High-Risk” group while including more dropouts in total dropouts. In addition, by predicting the reasons for dropouts and presenting guidelines to each department, the students could receive personalized counseling.
Finding a solution to the problem of student retention is an often-required task across Higher Education. Most often managers and academics alike rely on intuition and experience to identify the potential risk students and factors. This paper examines the literature surrounding current methods and measures in use in Learning Analytics. We find that while tools are available, they do not focus on earliest possible identification of struggling students. Our work defines a new descriptive statistic for student attendance and applies modern machine learning tools and techniques to create a predictive model. We demonstrate how students can be identified as early as week 3 (of the Fall semester) with approximately 97% accuracy. We, furthermore, situate this result within an appropriate pedagogical context to support its use as part of a more comprehensive student support mechanism.
High dropout rates and delayed completion in higher education are associated with considerable personal and social costs. In Latin America, 50% of students drop out, and only 50% of the remaining ones graduate on time. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify students at risk and understand the main factors of dropping out. Together with the emergence of efficient computational methods, the rich data accumulated in educational administrative systems have opened novel approaches to promote student persistence. In order to support research related to preventing student dropout, a dataset has been gathered and curated from Tecnologico de Monterrey students, consisting of 50 variables and 143,326 records. The dataset contains non-identifiable information of 121,584 High School and Undergraduate students belonging to the seven admission cohorts from August–December 2014 to 2020, covering two educational models. The variables included in this dataset consider factors mentioned in the literature, such as sociodemographic and academic information related to the student, as well as institution-specific variables, such as student life. This dataset provides researchers with the opportunity to test different types of models for dropout prediction, so as to inform timely interventions to support at-risk students.

High levels of school dropout are a major burden on the educational and professional development of a country''s inhabitants. A country''s prosperity depends, among other factors, on its ability to produce higher education graduates capable of moving a country forward. To alleviate the dropout problem, more and more institutions are turning to the possibilities that artificial intelligence can provide to predict dropout as early as possible. The difficulty of accessing personal data and privacy issues that it entails force the institutions to rely on the Academic Data of their students to create accurate and reliable predictive systems. This work focuses on creating the best possible predictive model based solely on academic data, and accordingly, its capacity to infer knowledge must be maximised. Thus, Feature Engineering and Instance Engineering techniques such as dealing with redundancy, significance of the features, correlation, cardinality features, missing values, creation or elimination of features, data fusion, removal of unuseful instances, binning, resampling, normalisation, or encoding are applied in detail before the construction of well-known models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine along with an Ensemble of them at different stages: Prior to enrolment, at the end of the first semester, at the end of the second semester, at the end of the third semester, and at the end of the fourth semester. Through the construction of these predictive models that serve as inputs to a decision support system, the application of effective dropout prevention policies can be applied.
Higher education institutions are faced with the challenge of low student retention rates and high number of dropouts. 41% of college students in United States do not finish their undergraduate degree program in six years, and 60% of them drop out in their first two years of study. It is crucial for universities and colleges to develop data-driven artificial intelligence systems to identify students at-risk as early as possible and provide timely guidance and support for them. However, most of the current classification approaches on early dropout prediction are unable to utilize all the information from historical data from previous cohorts to predict dropouts of current students in a few semesters. In this paper, we develop an Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) method to address the challenge of early prediction. The proposed framework is able to make full use of historical student record and effectively predict students at-risk of failing or dropping out in future semesters. Empirical results evaluated on a real-wold dataset show significant improvement with respect to the performance metrics in comparison to other existing methods. The application enabled by this proposed method provide additional support to students who are at risk of dropping out of college.
Higher education institutions are facing a major issue with student dropout rates, which is a global phenomenon that affects a significant portion of enrolled students, particularly those in their first year. The challenge is how to retain students who do not meet requirements during their first year and are at high risk of dropping out, which can have significant economic and social consequences as well as personal ramifications for the students themselves. Universities must prioritize identifying at-risk students and providing targeted assistance to prevent them from leaving the system. Machine learning (ML) models have proven effective in identifying students at risk of dropping out with a high degree of accuracy. In this study, we aim to construct a machine learning model using data extracted from the administration system (Neptun) to predict student dropout rates in the Business Informatics BSc course at the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of Budapest Business School.
Higher education institutions record a significant amount of data about their students, representing a considerable potential to generate information, knowledge, and monitoring. Both school dropout and educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area.
Higher education is a key factor in Thai national development. Promoting educational quality and improving the quality of learners are challenging for our government. One of the most common educational problems is a university dropout problem which has a negative impact not only on the economic level but also on the personal level of students. Then, in this study, we focus on the study of factors affecting undergraduates'' educational status and to create binary classification models for predicting their educational status whether will be Dropout or Other (i.e., other statuses which are not dropout) when they were studying at King Mongkut''s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Bangkok, Thailand. By applying the principles of data mining and machine learning techniques, we first collect data from the KMUTT internal data sources, i.e., Registrar''s Office and KMUTT Library After that we investigate the completeness and the quality of the data, as well as we, investigate which features are meant to improve the accuracy and applicability of our models. Particularly, the data used in our analysis are from 13,714 undergraduate students in 7 academic years which are from the academic year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020. We develop 3 classifiers based on a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classification. The results show that the prediction accuracy of gradient boosting, decision tree and random forest models are 93%, 92%, and 92% respectively. Moreover, we found that the top 5 important features are student''s academic year, high-school GPA, channels of university admission, student''s faculty, and gender. In summary, the model constructed using gradient boosting outperforms the others with the most accuracy and recall but the random forest model can outperform the others with the most dropout status precision.
In 2016, an office for institutional research (IR) promotion was constructed at Kobe Tokiwa University. The purpose of this office is to propose, manage, arrange, and collect information on students at the university not only as a general management strategy, but also to provide enrollment management. Work at the IR promotion office officially began 2016, at which point we began to perform university data management and collection duties. A promotion unit for IR was also newly established in 2017. In contrast to IR promotion practices in which the department is run solely by an administrative staff, the IR promotion unit at Kobe Tokiwa University is a collaborative group consisting of both staff and faculty. In this unit, we carried out an analysis focusing on the ''student dropout '' by using data from both current, graduate, and dropout students.
In 2016, Kobe Tokiwa University constructed an office for institutional research (IR) promotion. The purpose of this office is to propose, manage, arrange, and collect information on students at the university not only as a general management strategy, but also to support enrollment management. Our database currently contains 3,495 points of data (i.e., headcounts), each containing 1,246 items of numerical value. Last year, we reported on an analysis that focused on the ''student dropout'' phenomenon by using these data from both current graduate and dropout students. This year, we formulated a research question that is centered on predicting the probability of students'' progress and academic abilities through Enrollment Management / Institutional Research (EMIR). We obtained results with these data by processing them through a machine learning technique using random forest, which yielded a correction rate of about 90%.
In Bangladeshi institutions, the likelihood of student semester dropout has increased in recent years. A large number of university students, particularly in science background disciplines, are enrolled in a variety of undergraduate courses. Nevertheless, the perfection rate is poor. In general, students drop out for a variety of reasons, including academic, family, personal, and political concerns. The main focus of this study is to predict the risk of semester dropout in Bangladesh so that the massive dropout can be stopped. In this research, the current student information is preprocessed to discover the major reason as well as students whoever at the threat of semester dropout will help to grow a new structure in the area of higher education. To predict the dropout risk, random forest and logistic regression were practiced for obtaining the detection model.
In Colombia, the desertion average rate shows that only around half of the students that begin an undergraduate program are finishing their studies. Although several models have been developed, the results of the implementation of strategies for student retention have not been sufficiently effective. Therefore, this study focuses on the creation of robust predictive models that allow timely anticipation of the risk that an engineering student will retire prematurely from the program. This phenomenon is analyzed in an empirical way through a methodology of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) using different machine learning techniques. Results show that the academic cost (in terms of the number of subjects viewed) and the semester the student entered have a significant impact on the probability of dropout occurring, especially when considering the dropout in the firsts semester. Then, acting on the students predicted by the model might reduce the number of dropouts. Copyright
In higher education, many students exceed the expected time to complete their undergraduate programs. This delay is called retention, which can lead to program abandonment. STEM undergraduate programs, in particular, have higher retention and dropout rates when compared to other non-STEM programs. The students in such programs end up exchanging or dropping out the programs before graduating, causing waste in economic, social and academic terms. In this context, Recommendation Systems can be used to support students and managers in choosing disciplines, contributing for them achieving better academic performance and thus aiming to improve student learning and engagement and mitigate retention. For constructing these Recommendation Systems, Educational Data Mining techniques, including machine learning algorithms, can be used to identify and predict retention situations and contribute to reducing their occurrence. The aim of this paper is to present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for identifying the use of Educational Data Mining methodologies, techniques and tools to implement Recommendation Systems with a focus on preventing student retention in higher education programs. We selected studies available in digital libraries that are international references in publications of scientific articles, in order to answer the following research question: What machine learning methods were used in Recommendation Systems in the context of Educational Data Mining? Among the various studies found to reduce student retention rates, most used methods to predict student grades. We observed that there are many papers proposing the use of machine learning methods for predicting failure in disciplines, either through regressors or classifiers. However, just a few studies have proposed Recommendation Systems to assist students in choosing subjects at the time of enrollment for the next term, which indicates a large area for the development of further future work in this field.
In higher educational institutions, student enrollment management and increasing student retention are fundamental performance metrics to academic and financial sustainability. In many educational institutions, high student attrition rates are due to a variety of circumstances, including demographic and personal factors such as age, gender, academic background, financial abilities, and academic degree of choice. In this study, we will make use of machine learning approaches to develop prediction models that can predict student enrollment behavior and the students who have a high risk of dropping out. This can help higher education institutions develop proper intervention plans to reduce attrition rates and increase the probability of student academic success. In this study, real data is taken from Abu Dhabi School of Management (ADSM) in the UAE. This data is used in developing the student enrollment model and identifying the student’s characteristics who are willing to enroll in a specific program, in addition to that, this research managed to find out the characteristics of the students who are under the risk of dropout.
In past decade, there have been several students who have dropped out from the educational institutions and it is increasing rapidly. This has become one of the challenging factors for the educational institution. The students are getting into the institution andembarking their learning with several expectations and dreams. The expectations of the students have not fulfilleddue to various factors such as staff, management, parents, course chosen etc., that make them drop from their registered curriculum. However, this has become the main issue for all educational institutes wherein several researchers introduced the technique of data mining for analysing as well as predicting the student''s dropout. Therefore, this paper focuses on early finding of dropout variables as an advance by dimensionality reduction using feature selection and extraction methods. In feature extraction, there may be an occurrence of imbalanceddata that may affect the significance of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Thus, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is subsequently added with Principal Compound Analysis (PCA) whereas the oversampling of imbalanced data is managed to balanced dataset. Moreover, the 1,243 student''s data have been collectedand analysed using proposed PCA-SMOTE to allow for a more accurate forecast in case of dropout. Accuracy performance related to PCA-SMOTE has been 97.6% that is evaluated through confusion matrix parameter and compared with existing ML to find out the exact students who are not satisfied with their fulfilment in the environment of education institute.
In Portugal, the dropout rate of university courses is around 29%. Understanding the reasons behind such a high desertion rate can drastically improve the success of students and universities. This work applies existing data mining techniques to predict the academic dropout mainly using the academic grades. Four different machine learning techniques are presented and analyzed. The dataset consists of 331 students who were previously enrolled in the Computer Engineering degree at the Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD). The study aims to detect students who may prematurely drop out using existing methods. The most relevant data features were identified using the Permutation Feature Importance technique. In the second phase, several methods to predict the dropouts were applied. Then, each machine learning technique’s results were displayed and compared to select the best approach to predict academic dropout. The methods used achieved good results, reaching an F1-Score of 81% in the final test set, concluding that students’ marks somehow incorporate their living conditions.
In recent years, there has been evidence of a growing interest on the part of universities to know in advance the academic performance of their students and allow them to establish timely strategies to avoid desertion and failure. One of the biggest challenges to predicting student performance is presented in the course ''Programming Fundamentals'' of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems Engineering careers in Peruvian universities for high student dropout rates. The objective of this research was to explore the efficiency of Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) to predict the academic performance of students during the seventh, eighth, twelfth, and sixteenth weeks of the academic semester, which allowed us to identify students at risk of failing the course. This research compares several predictive models, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A major challenge machine learning algorithms face is a class imbalance in a dataset, resulting in over-fitting to the available data and, consequently, low accuracy. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data needed in our proposal. From the experimental results based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, the superiority of our model is verified concerning a better classification, with 98.3% accuracy in week 8 using LSTM-GAN, followed by DNN-GAN with 98.1% accuracy.
In this article, a large data set containing every course taken by every undergraduate student in a major university in Canada over 10 years is analysed. Modern machine learning algorithms can use large data sets to build useful tools for the data provider, in this case, the university. In this article, two classifiers are constructed using random forests. To begin, the first two semesters of courses completed by a student are used to predict if they will obtain an undergraduate degree. Secondly, for the students that completed a program, their major is predicted using once again the first few courses they have registered to. A classification tree is an intuitive and powerful classifier and building a random forest of trees improves this classifier. Random forests also allow for reliable variable importance measurements. These measures explain what variables are useful to the classifiers and can be used to better understand what is statistically related to the students’ situation. The results are two accurate classifiers and a variable importance analysis that provides useful information to university administrations.
In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students'' risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students'' risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student''s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.
In this paper, we describe the results of the educational machine learning case study with the aim to predict first-year computer science students'' dropout in the Virumaa College of Tallinn University of Technology and determine factors that influence dropout rates. In this study two different datasets are used: (1) data obtained from the TalTech study information system; (2) students’ history and study results collected in Virumaa College. To build predictive models, the following machine learning algorithms are applied: Naïve Bayes, decision trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. As a result of this study were evaluated how the dropout prediction accuracies change from the moment of the students’ admission to the end of the first semester. We found, that data that were available about students before enrollment allowed to predict dropout with 70% of accuracy. Using data that obtained from first semester allowed to rise prediction accuracy to 90%. Besides, the factors were determined that are related with drop-out and that are not. Any higher education institution can conduct a similar study, since it is conducted on publicly available data from the official academic information environment.
In this paper, we examine whether early warning signals from accounting courses (such as early engagement and early formative performance) are predictive of first-year progression outcomes, and whether this data is more predictive than personal data (such as gender and prior achievement). Using a machine learning approach, results from a sample of 609 first-year students from a continental European university show that early warnings from accounting courses are strongly predictive of first-year progression, and more so than data available at the start of the first year. In addition, the further the student is along their journey of the first undergraduate year, the more predictive the accounting engagement and performance data becomes for the prediction of programme progression outcomes. Our study contributes to the study of early warning signals for dropout through machine learning in accounting education, suggests implications for accounting educators, and provides useful pointers for further research in this area.
In this paper, we have presented some results of undergraduate student retention using machine learning algorithms classifying the student data. We have also made some improvements to the classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural networks supported by Weka software toolkit. The experiments revealed that the main factors that influence student retention in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) are the cumulative grade point average (GPA) and total credit hours (TCH) taken. The target functions derived from the bare minimum decision tree and SVM algorithms were further revised to create a two-layer neural network and a regression to predict the retention. These new models improved the classification accuracy.
In this study, an early warning system predicting first-year undergraduate student academic performance is developed for higher education institutions. The significant factors that affect first-year student success are derived and discussed such that they can be used for policy developments by related bodies. The dataset used in experimental analyses includes 11,698 freshman students'' data. The problem is constructed as classification models predicting whether a student will be successful or unsuccessful at the end of the first year. A total of 69 input variables are utilized in the models. Naive Bayes, decision tree and random forest algorithms are compared over model prediction performances. Random forest models outperformed others and reached 90.2% accuracy. Findings show that the models including the fall semester CGPA variable performed dramatically better. Moreover, the student''s programme name and university placement exam score are identified as the other most significant variables. A critical discussion based on the findings is provided. The developed model may be used as an early warning system, such that necessary actions can be taken after the second week of the spring semester for students predicted to be unsuccessful to increase their success and prevent attrition.
In this this work, a study is presented with quantitative variables using machine learning tools to detect undergraduate students at risk of dropping out and the factors associated with this behavior. Clustering algorithms and classification methods were tested to determine the predictive power of several variables regarding the dropout phenomenon on an unbalanced database of 14,495 undergraduate students with a real dropout rate of 8.5% and a retention rate of 91.5%. The usual classification criterion that assigns individuals to a class if their probability of belonging to it is greater than 50% provided accuracies of 13.2% in the dropout prediction and 99.4% in the retention prediction. Among eight classifiers, Random Forest was selected and applied along with Threshold Probability, which allowed us to gradually increase the dropout precision to more than 50%, while maintaining retention and global precisions above 70%. Through this study, it was found that the main variables associated with student dropouts were their academic performance during the early weeks of the first semester, their average grade in the previous academic levels, the previous mathematics score, and the entrance exam score. Other important variables were the number of class hours being taken, student age, funding status of scholarships, English level, and the number of dropped subjects in the early weeks. Given the trade-off between dropout and retention precisions, our results can guide educational institutions to focus on the most appropriate academic support strategies to help students at real risk of dropping out.

In this work, we evaluate the risk of early dropout in undergraduate studies using causal inference methods, and focusing on groups of students who have a relatively higher dropout risk. We use a large dataset consisting of undergraduates admitted to multiple study programs at eight faculties/schools of our university. Using data available at enrollment time, we develop Machine Learning (ML) methods to predict university dropout and underperformance, which show an AUC of 0.70 and 0.74 for each risk respectively. Among important drivers of dropout over which the first-year students have some control, we find that first year workload (i.e., the number of credits taken) is a key one, and we mainly focus on it. We determine the effect of taking a relatively lighter workload in the first year on dropout risk using causal inference methods: Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Inverse Propensity score Weighting (IPW), Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted (AIPW), and Doubly Robust Orthogonal Random Forest (DROrthoForest). Our results show that a reduction in workload reduces dropout risk.
Industry is rapidly moving towards data-driven solutions. Mining historical data on manufactured goods and services is becoming the customary approach for decision-making these days. This work proposes to extend these now standard operating procedures in industry to the educational arena. The Department of Industrial Engineering at University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez (IE@UPRM) is currently planning a curricular reform. Unidentified student records from students enrolled in the IE program within the last ten years were used to create a profile of successful IE students. The approach was to retrospectively examine students before starting at UPRM, throughout their undergraduate careers, and via exit metrics; in order to determine curricular reform efforts that will increase retention and improve a student''s likelihood to obtain a degree from IE@UPRM on time. Traditional multivariate statistics and machine learning algorithms were used to extract the structural patterns of successful alumni from IE@UPRM. These patterns allowed to identify core courses that require an intervention during a curricular reform and those elective courses that should be evaluated as core courses in the near future. Last but not least, these retrospective analyses allowed pin-point specific populations on which to focus future retention efforts.
Introduction: The concepts of causation and prediction are different, and have different implications for practice. This distinction is applied here to studies of the problem of student attrition (although it is more widely applicable). Background: Studies of attrition from nursing courses have tended to concentrate on causation, trying, largely unsuccessfully, to elicit what causes drop out. However, the problem may more fruitfully be cast in terms of predicting who is likely to drop out. Methods: One powerful method for attempting to make predictions is rule induction. This paper reports the use of the Answer Tree package from SPSS for that purpose. Data: The main data set consisted of 3978 records on 528 nursing students, split into a training set and a test set. The source was standard university student records. Results: The method obtained 84% sensitivity, 70% specificity, and 94% accuracy on previously unseen cases. Discussion: The method requires large amounts of high quality data. When such data are available, rule induction offers a way to reduce attrition. It would be desirable to compare its results with those of predictions made by tutors using more informal conventional methods.
Introduction: University dropout is now considered a complex phenomenon that goes beyond the number of students not enrolled and that is continuously growing, especially in the first years of study. Objective: In the present study, a prediction model combining Survival Analysis, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, under the Machine Learning philosophy, is proposed for the early diagnosis of possible factors causing dropout in university students. Methods: The proposal consists of 3 phases: the Survival Analysis that allows estimating the probability of permanence of the student (survival). Phase 2 starts from the probability value obtained in the previous phase and uses it as a response variable in the modeling process based on Decision Trees to establish survival patterns around the variables considered. Finally, in phase 3, the critical variables in the model are identified using the Random Forest. Results: The proposed methodology allowed the design of a prediction model to identify the main segmentation variables in behavior patterns of possible cases of academic dropout. Conclusion: Even though the proposal was developed considering a particular case of a Chilean university, the efficient combination of metaheuristics allows the extrapolation of the methodology to any context and academic reality. However, the conditions and needs of each institution must be considered.
Investigations have applied the Machine Learning to predict whether a college student culminate or not his studies, however, in each scenario the factors that influence student graduation are multiples, then: how predict defection students at the U niversidad N acional of Santa - Peru with a precision greater than 90%? In the present research a model based on Multilayer Neural Networks was trained to predict the academic dropout at the School of Engineering from the aforementioned university, to Neural Networks Multilayer of 6 layers, it provided a model with an accuracy of the 98.97% in the training set, which is satisfactory in relation to alternative models they worked in 15 different experiments and which were compared with classification algorithms obtained in the service AutoAI of IBM Watson Studio that returned to classifier XGB as the best predictor with an accuracy of 87.1 %.
Machine learning is a software tool that allows information present in databases to be converted into intelligent decisions based on data and not on experience or feelings. This work presents a review of the algorithms used in the classification of student performance present in the database of the national technical university, specifically in the software engineering career. Information classification analysis using ma- chine learning algorithm has become a modern and powerful instrument, which could help academic institutions improve retention and performance rate of courses by students and with this obtain a more general view of student performance before starting the course based on information from other courses and general student variables in order to reduce the risk of failure. The main objective of this work is to describe the variables used by the National Technical University and the application of different automated learning algorithms in order to obtain the metrics that allow demonstrating the best algorithm among those studied. Finally, the article concludes with a classification algorithm that provides an accuracy of around 80% to 82% that can be replicated in other university institutions.
Malaysia citizens are categorized into three different income groups which are the Top 20 Percent (T20), Middle 40 Percent (M40), and Bottom 40 Percent (B40). One of the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) is to elevate the B40 household group towards the middle-income society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households belong to this group. The government of Malaysia has widened access to higher education for the B40 group in an effort to reduce the gaps in socioeconomics and to improve their living standards. Statistical data shows that since 2013, a yearly intake of students in bachelor’s degree programs in Malaysia’s public universities amounts to more than 85,000. Despite this huge number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate, including students from low-income family background. Data mining approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping out in general education. However, machine learning related works on student attrition in Malaysia’s higher education is generally lacking. Therefore, in this research, three machine learning models were developed using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network algorithm in order to classify attrition among B40 students in bachelor’s degree programs in Malaysia’s public universities. Comparative performance analysis between the three models indicates that the Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the other two models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with the value of 95.93%, 97.10%, 81.26% and 88.50%, respectively. Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant difference in performance between the Random Forest model and Decision Tree model but no statistically significant difference between Random Forest models and Artificial Neural Network model.
Many students in Bulgarian universities drop out of the university before completing their studies. Identifying students at risk of dropping out allows timely taking measures for their retention. The paper presents the results of a study conducted among students of engineering programs at Trakia University - Stara Zagora. The collected data are subjected to processing, which aims to find the most important attributes that determine the risk of dropping out of university. The processing is done with Weka open source software. Different algorithms for selecting attributes with different search methods are applied. The most appropriate attribute selection algorithm was selected after applying the BayesNet classifier to the results obtained. The indicators TP rate, Precision and F-measure were compared. When applying InfoGainAttributeEval, the highest results are obtained for the accuracy of the classification. At the next stage, it is planned to expand the study among a larger number of students from different programs and create an effective forecasting model.
Measuring student performance based on both qualitative and quantitative factors is essential because many undergraduate students could not be able to complete their degree in recent pasts. At present, students’ dropout rate in university is gradually increasing and many bright students sometimes just cannot cope with the universities. The first-year result of a student is very important because in the majority of cases this drives the students to be either motivated or demotivated. So, the first-year student performance of a renowned university in Bangladesh is investigated in this paper. This research is mainly based on finding the reasons for students’ different types of results and then predicting students’ performance based on those eleven significant factors. For this purpose, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm, random forests (RF) have been used for classifying students’ different levels of results and predicting students’ performances. The input dataset for both training and testing were taken by merging the values obtained from two surveys done on students and experts using fuzzy ANFIS analysis. The result exhibits that RF can perform the classification of multiple classes based on many distinguishing features with 96.88 percent accuracy. This proposed model can also be applied to predict course-wise students’ performances and its precision can also be greatly improved by adding new factors.
Nowadays many educational institutions crucially need to understand the dynamics at the basis of the university dropout (UD) phe- nomenon. However, the most informative educational data are personal and subject to strict privacy constraints. The challenge is therefore to develop a data driven system which accurately predicts students dropouts while preserving the privacy of individual data instances. In the present paper we investigate this problem, making use of data collected at Univer- sity of Genoa as a case study.
Nowadays, Education Data Mining (EDM) plays a very important role in higher education institutions. Plenty of algorithms have been employed to measure student''s GPA in the next semester''s courses. The results can be used to early identify dropout students or help students choose the elective courses which are appropriate for them. The most widely used methods are machine learning, however, the problem is the accuracy which can be changed from dataset to dataset. More importantly, the performance of prediction models can be affected by the characteristic of dataset associated with the applied model. In this paper, we build a distributed platform on Spark to predict missing grades of elective courses for undergraduate students. The paper compares several methods that are based on the combination of Collaborative Filtering & Matrix Factorization (namely Alternative Least Square). We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using a dataset provided by Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT). The dataset consists of information about undergraduate students from 2006 to 2017. Depending on the characteristics of our dataset, the paper highlights that Alternative Least Square with non-negative constraint achieves the better results than others in comparison.
One of the biggest problems in higher education is student dropout. Prior to the pandemic, one of the biggest problems for university institutions was the dropout and dropout of many of their students. Today, the situation has become even more critical, as the pandemic has forced many people to drop out of school for a variety of reasons, whether financial or personal. Investigating the causes of dropout with appropriate means to reduce it contributes to decision making within academic management. The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning model that generates early warnings about course loss, which is based on historical data of pupils and students. The model is based on historical data from an undergraduate program that includes, student grades, at various points in time, percentage of course loss in previous semesters, percentage of student loss in previous semesters, subjects passed at the time of evaluating the data, along with student and course average. This would facilitate the identification and internal management of alarms for the early detection of potential dropouts, as well as efficiently display the results found with the execution of these models.
One of the most significant indicators for assessing the quality of university careers is the dropout rate between the first and second year. Both literature on the subjects and the results that emerged from numerous specific investigations into the dropouts of the university system, showed the crucial importance of this junction between the first and the second year. Reasons for dropping out can be quite varied, ranging from incorrect and/or insufficient prospective student orientation, the willingness or need to find a job as quickly as possible, to a lack of awareness of not being able to cope with a particular course of study rather than another. In this paper we focus specifically on the problem of dropouts in Italy, addressing it from a dual point of view. At an aggregate level, the analysis deals with dropout rates in Italy between the first and second year, in order to identify the main trends and dynamics at the national level. Subsequently, we analyze individual-level data from the University of Bari Aldo Moro, aiming to identify the most important contributing factors. This individual-level approach has emerged over recent years, and is generally known as ‘Educational Data Mining’, focused on the development of ad hoc methods that can be used to discover regularities and new information within databases from contexts related to education. Using supervised classification methods, we are able to identify retrospectively the profile of students who are most likely to dropout.
Over the last few decades, there has been a gradual deterioration in higher education in all three areas: the academic setting (both staff and students), as well as research and development output (including graduates). All colleges and universities are essentially focused on improving management decision-making and educating pupils. High-quality higher education can be obtained through a variety of methods. One method is to accurately forecast pupils'' achievement in their chosen educational context. There are numerous prediction models from which to pick. While it is unclear whether there are any markers that can predict whether a kid will be an academic genius, a dropout, or an average performer, the researcher reports student achievement. This article presents a metaheuristics and machine learning-based method for the classification and prediction of student performance. Firstly, features are selected using a relief algorithm. Machine learning classifiers such as BPNN, RF, and NB are used to classify student academic performance data. BPNN is having better accuracy for classification and prediction of student academic performance.
Predicting and understanding different key outcomes in a student’s academic trajectory such as grade point average, academic retention, and degree completion would allow targeted intervention programs in higher education. Most of the predictive models developed for those key outcomes have been based on traditional methodological approaches. However, these models assume linear relationships between variables and do not always yield accurate predictive classifications. On the other hand, the use of machine-learning approaches such as artificial neural networks has been very effective in the classification of various educational outcomes, overcoming the limitations of traditional methodological approaches. In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network models, with a backpropagation algorithm, were developed to classify levels of grade point average, academic retention, and degree completion outcomes in a sample of 655 students from a private university. Findings showed a high level of accuracy for all the classifications. Among the predictors, learning strategies had the greatest contribution for the prediction of grade point average. Coping strategies were the best predictors for degree completion, and background information had the largest predictive weight for the identification of students who will drop out or not from the university programs.
Predicting dropout in universities has become a concern in several countries around the world. With the introduction of new information and communication technologies, new factors have appeared that influence student dropout in universities. This article proposes an approach to machine learning based on logistic regression techniques and decision trees and factors such as Internet addiction, addiction to social networks and addiction to technology, that affect the desertion of students in universities. As a result, it was obtained that the technique with the highest percentage of dropout precision was decision trees with 91.70%.
Predicting student dropout is a challenging problem in the education sector. This is due to an imbalance in student dropout data, mainly because the number of registered students is always higher than the number of dropout students. Developing a model without taking the data imbalance issue into account may lead to an ungeneralized model. In this study, different data balancing techniques were applied to improve prediction accuracy in the minority class while maintaining a satisfactory overall classification performance. Random Over Sampling, Random Under Sampling, Synthetic Minority Over Sampling, SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbor and SMOTE with Tomek links were tested, along with three popular classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Publicly accessible datasets from Tanzania and India were used to evaluate the effectiveness of balancing techniques and prediction models. The results indicate that SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbor achieved the best classification performance on the 10-fold holdout sample. Furthermore, Logistic Regression correctly classified the largest number of dropout students (57348 for the Uwezo dataset and 13430 for the India dataset) using the confusion matrix as the evaluation matrix. The applications of these models allow for the precise prediction of at-risk students and the reduction of dropout rates.
Predicting student performance, preventing failure and identifying the factors influencing student dropout are issues that have attracted a great deal of research interest recently. In this study, we employ and evaluate several machine learning algorithms to identify students at-risk and predict student dropout of university programs based on the data available at the time of enrollment (secondary school performance, personal details). We also present a data-driven decision support platform for education directorate and stakeholders. The models are built on data of 15,825 undergraduate students from Budapest University of Technology and Economics enrolled between 2010 and 2017 and finished their undergraduate studies either by graduation or dropping out. We handle the problem of missing data by imputation. After performing feature extraction and feature selection, a wide range of classifiers have been trained including Decision Tree-based algorithms, Naive Bayes, k-NN, Linear Models and Deep Learning with different input settings. The methods were tested using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUC of the best models, Gradient Boosted Trees and Deep Learning, were 0.808 and 0.811 respectively.
Predicting students'' academic performance at an early stage of a semester is one of the most crucial research topics in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM). Students are facing various difficulties in courses like ''Programming'' and ''Data Structures'' through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students'' data gathered from various educational settings to predict students'' academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students'' academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students'' academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students'' performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.
Predicting students'' performance is one of the most important topics for learning contexts such as schools and universities, since it helps to design effective mechanisms that improve academic results and avoid dropout, among other things. These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students'' activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students'' knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students'' performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students'' performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others.
Problem Statement: There has recently been interest in educational databases containing a variety of valuable but sometimes hidden data that can be used to help less successful students to improve their academic performance. The extraction of hidden information from these databases often implements aspects of the educational data mining (EDM) theory, which aims to study available data in order to shed light on more valuable, hidden information. Data clustering, classification, and regression methods such as K-means clustering, neural networks (NN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machines (SVM) can be used for to predict aspects of the educational data. EDM outputs can ultimately identify which students will need additional help to improve their grade point averages (GPAs) at graduation. Purpose of Study: This study aims to implement several prediction techniques in data mining to assist educational institutions with predicting their students'' GPAs at graduation. If students are predicted to have low GPAs at graduation, then extra efforts can be made to improve their academic performance and, in turn, GPAs. Methods: NN, SVM, and ELM algorithms are applied to data of computer education and instructional technology students to predict their GPAs at graduation. Findings and Results: A comparative analysis of the results indicates that the SVM technique yielded more accurate predictions at a rate of 97.98%. By contrast, the ELM method yielded the second most accurate prediction rate (94.92%) evaluated based on the criterion of correlation coefficient. NN reported the least accurate prediction rate (93.76%). Conclusions and Recommendations: The use of data mining methodologies has recently expanded for a variety of educational purposes. The assessment of students'' needs, dropout liability, performance, and placement test improvement are some important emerging data mining applications in education. Since educational institutions have several seemingly unsolvable domain-related problems, this study''s results reveal that EDM can assist with how educational institutions analyze and solve these problems. Furthermore, ensemble models can be used to obtain improved results, while feature selection algorithms can be used to reduce the computational complexity of the prediction methods.
Purpose: The prediction of student attrition is critical to facilitate retention mechanisms. This study aims to focus on implementing a method to predict student attrition in the upper years of a physiotherapy program. Design/methodology/approach: Machine learning is a computer tool that can recognize patterns and generate predictive models. Using a quantitative research methodology, a database of 336 university students in their upper-year courses was accessed. The participant''s data were collected from the Financial Academic Management and Administration System and a platform of Universidad Autónoma de Chile. Five quantitative and 11 qualitative variables were chosen, associated with university student attrition. With this database, 23 classifiers were tested based on supervised machine learning. Findings: About 23.58% of males and 17.39% of females were among the attrition student group. The mean accuracy of the classifiers increased based on the number of variables used for the training. The best accuracy level was obtained using the “Subspace KNN” algorithm (86.3%). The classifier “RUSboosted trees” yielded the lowest number of false negatives and the higher sensitivity of the algorithms used (78%) as well as a specificity of 86%. Practical implications: This predictive method identifies attrition students in the university program and could be used to improve student retention in higher grades. Originality/value: The study has developed a novel predictive model of student attrition from upper-year courses, useful for unbalanced databases with a lower number of attrition students.
Quality education is necessary as it provides the basis for equality in society. It is also significantly important that educational institutes be focused on tracking and improving the academic performance of each student. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors (i.e., diverse backgrounds, behaviors, etc.) that help students perform well. However, the increasing number of students makes it challenging and leaves a negative impact on credibility and resources due to the high dropout rates. Researchers tend to work on a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques for predicting student performance without giving much importance to their spatial and behavioral factors. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method that considers weighted key factors which have an impact on their performance. To achieve this, we first surveyed by considering experts’ opinions in selecting weighted key factors using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). Secondly, a geospatial-based machine learning technique was developed which integrated the relationship between students’ location-based features, semester-wise behavioral features, and academic features. Three different experiments were conducted to prove the superiority and predict student performance. The experimental results reveal that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) achieved higher accuracy of 90.9% as compared to other machine learning methods, for instance, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree (DT). Scientific analysis techniques (i.e., Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM)) and machine learning feature engineering techniques (i.e., Variance Threshold (VT)) were used in two different experiments for selecting features where scientific analysis techniques had achieved better accuracy. The finding of this research is that, along with the past performance and social status key factors, the semester behavior factors have a lot of impact on students’ performance. We performed spatial statistical analysis on our dataset in the context of Pakistan, which provided us with the spatial areas of students’ performance; furthermore, their results are described in the data analysis section.
Recently, machine learning (ML) has evolved and finds its application in higher education (HE) for various data analysis. Studies have shown that such an emerging field in educational technology provides meaningful insights into several dimensions of educational quality. An in-depth analysis of the application of ML could have a positive impact on the HE sector. However, there is a scarcity of a systematic review of HE literature to gain from the overarching trends and patterns discovered using ML. This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analyses of research studies that have reported on the application of ML in HE. The differentiating factors of this study are primarily vested in the meta-analyses including a specific focus on student academic performance, at-risk, and attrition in HE. Our detailed investigation adopts an evidence-based framework called PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for reporting the findings of our systematic review and meta-analyses of literature on the use of ML models, algorithms, evaluation metrics, and other criteria, including demographics for assessing student academic performance, at-risk and attrition in HE. After undergoing the PRISMA steps such as selection criteria and filtering, we arrive at a small-scale dataset of 89 relevant studies published from 2010 to 2020 for an in-depth analysis. The results show the outcomes of the quantitative analysis of the application of ML types, models, evaluation metrics, and other related demographics and provide quality insights of publication patterns and future trends towards predicting and monitoring student academic progress in HE.
Recently, many global universities have faced high student failure and early dropout rates reflecting on the quality of education. To tackle this problem, forecasting student success as early as possible with machine learning is one of the most important approaches used in modern universities. Thus, this study aims to analyze and compare models for the early prediction of student performance with six machine learning based on Thailand’s education curriculum. A large dataset was collected from the admission scores of 5,919 students during 2011-2021 of 10 programs in the Faculty of Science at Ubon Ratchathani University. The methodology was carried out using Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, and Scikit-Learn to build the models for prediction. To obtain a higher result, we needed not only to find high-performance prediction models, but also to tune hyperparameter configurations consisting of 138 possible different patterns to identify the best-tuned model for each classifier. Furthermore, we investigated significantly important predictors affecting student success for 10 programs in our faculty. In the experiments, the process was divided into two parts: First, we evaluated effective models using a confusion matrix with 10-fold cross-validation. The results showed that random forest (RF) had the highest F1-measure of 86.87%. While predictive models using fine-tuned RF of 10 programs claimed accuracy of about 72% to 93%. Second, we computed the importance of each feature with fine-tuned RF classifiers. The result showed that national test scores (e.g., ONET-English, ONET-Math, ONET-Science, ONET-Social studies, ONET-Thai, and PAT2), entry type, and school grade (e.g., art, English, GPA, health, math, science, and technology) are highly influential features for predicting student success. In summary, these results yield many benefits for other relevant educational institutions to enhance student performance, plan class strategies and undertake decision-making processes.
Reducing the students’ dropout is one of the biggest challenges faced by educational institutions, especially in underdeveloped countries. Identification of the student with the highest risk of dropping out is generally used to apply corrective actions (WHO). Therefore, it is also important to determine WHEN a student will drop out, which is fundamental to planning preventive actions. In this work, we perform a study to quantitatively compare several approaches to address the early identification of dropout students in universities. We categorize our study into three main methods families, i.e., analytical methods, traditional classification methods, and probabilistic methods. The first is exploited at preprocessing step for selecting significant variables into the dropout identification task. The second uses machine learning models to classify students into dropout prone or non-dropout prone classes. The third family uses survival models to determine when the student would desert. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the classification models, the Kappa coefficient was incorporated into the usual machine learning metrics and shows that Kappa is handy for evaluating performance in unbalanced data. Similarly, in the survival models, the concordance index was applied to evaluate the predictive capacity. Our approach was applied over a real data set of Peruvian university graduate students to identify when and who will drop out.
School dropout is one of the most complex and crucial problems in the field of education. It permeates the several levels and teaching modalities and has generated social, economic, political, academic and financial damage to all involved in the educational process. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop efficient methods for prediction of the students at risk of dropping out, enabling the adoption of proactive actions to minimize the situation. Thus, this work aims to present the potentialities of an intelligent system developed for the prediction of the group of students at risk of dropping out in higher education classroom courses. The system was developed using a Fuzzy-ARTMAP Neural Network, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, which makes the continued learning of the system possible. This research was developed in the technology courses of the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso, based on the academic and socioeconomic records of the students. The results, showing a success rate of the dropout group around 92% and overall accuracy over 85%, highlights the reliability and accuracy of the system. It is highlighted that the strength and boldness of this research lies in the possibility of identifying early the eminent school dropout using only the enrollment data.
School dropout permeates various teaching modalities and has generated social, economic, political, and academic damage to those involved in the educational process. Evasion data in higher education courses show the pessimistic scenario of fragility that configures education, mainly in underdeveloped countries. In this context, this paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for predicting dropout using machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Multilayer perceptron, and Deep Learning based on socioeconomic data. With the use of socioeconomic data, it is possible to identify in the act of pre-registration who are the students likely to evade, since this information is filled in the pre-registration form. This paper proposes the automation of the prediction process by a method capable of obtaining information that would be difficult and time consuming for humans to obtain, contributing to a more accurate prediction. With the advent of IoT, it is possible to create a highly efficient and flexible tool for improving management and service-related issues, which can provide a prediction of dropout of new students entering higher-level courses, allowing personalized follow-up to students to reverse a possible dropout. The approach was validated by analyzing the accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision parameters. The results showed that the developed system obtained 99.34% accuracy, 99.34% F1 score, 100% recall, and 98.69% precision using Decision Tree. Thus, the developed system presents itself as a viable option for use in universities to predict students likely to leave university.
Several methodologies based on statistical methods or machine learning theories have been applied in previous studies for the modeling of student retention. However, most prior studies were based solely on a specific modeling method of authors'' choice. Direct comparison of competing methods using identical collection of student retention data was rarely provided. The purpose of this paper is to present a direct comparison of prominent methods for modeling student retention using the same data. Four modeling methodologies (neural networks, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and structural equation modeling) are included in this study. These competing methods were implemented on five retention models with various collections of cognitive and non-cognitive factors, ranging from 9 to 71 variables. The retention data in this study were collected from more than 1500 first year engineering students in a large Midwestern university. The eleven cognitive attributes include high school GPAs, standardized test scores, and the grades and number of semesters in math, science and English courses in high school. The non-cognitive variables were collected through Student Attitudinal Success Instrument (SASI), covering the following nine constructs: Leadership, Deep Learning, Surface Learning, Teamwork, Academic Self-efficacy, Motivation, Metacognition, Expectancy-value, and Major Decision. The following findings are found during this study. First, among the five retention models, the two hybrid models with both cognitive and non-cognitive factors always perform better than models consisting of either only cognitive, or only non-cognitive factors. Second, the addition of non-cognitive items can significantly improve the prediction performance of a cognitive-only model when applied properly. Third, neural network methods perform better than the other three methodologies in performance indices, followed by logistic regression. However, logistic regression may be attractive to some researchers for its ease in implementation and lower requirements for computation power. Finally, the authors found the commonly used threshold (0.05) for including variables in stepwise selection process in logistic regression may not result in the best model for prediction performance. The authors strongly suggest that researchers explore beyond this typical threshold in order to find the best performing collection of variables.
Student attrition represents one of the greatest challenges facing U.S. postsecondary institutions. Approximately 40 percent of students seeking a bachelor’s degree do not graduate within 6 years; among nontraditional students, who make up half of the undergraduate population, dropout rates are even higher. In this study, we developed a machine learning classifier using the XGBoost model and data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study: 2012/14 to predict nontraditional student dropout. In comparison with baseline models, the XGBoost model and logistic regression model with features identified by the XGBoost model displayed superior performance in predicting dropout. The predictive ability of the model and the features it identified as being most important in predicting nontraditional student dropout can inform discussion among educators seeking ways to identify and support at-risk students early in their postsecondary careers.
Student dropout in higher education is a complex issue and as a process it includes many factors which may affect each other. This paper explores the use and application of a probabilistic supervised machine learning technique for predicting university student dropout to obtain insights on the students at risk and prevent them from dropping out the studies. Data from a public university in the Republic of Kosovo were obtained and examined. The dataset comprises instances of students'' dropouts for the past six academic years along with their demographics, grades, enrollment details etc. Logistic Regression, as one of the most widely used Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms, was used to build the model and produce the predictions. First, a statistical analysis was conducted and after the data preprocessing, logistic regression classifier was implemented. The results show that a high prediction accuracy was reached, with a percentage of 90%, and a F1 score of 0.85, indicating that the model is performing great and the predictions results are reliable.
Student dropout is a phenomenon that affects all higher education institutions in Chile, with costs for people, institutions and the State the reported retention rate of first year students for all Chilean universities was of 75%. Despite the extensive research and the implementation of various models to identify dropout causes and risk groups, few of them have been carried out in the Chilean higher education context.Our work attempts to identify, using machine learning methods, the variables with highest predictive value for student dropout by the end of the first year of study, within a 6-year Informatics Engineering programme with a rather high dropout rate of 21.9% reported on 2018. In that regard, we use the data of 4 cohorts of students (2012-2016) enrolled at the programme, to feed a random forest feature selection process. We later build a decision tree using the identified relevant features, which we later test using data of the 2017-2018 cohorts of students.Despite the fact that the decision tree is over-fitted (97,21% training accuracy against 81.01% test accuracy), the process sheds light on the nature of the variables that determine whether or not a student remains at the end of their first year of study at the University. 6 of the identified factors are academic, and the remaining one is social-cultural.
Student dropout is a problem for both students and universities. However, in the crises that Lebanon is going through, it is becoming a serious financial problem for Lebanese private universities. To try to minimize it, it must be predicted in order to implement the appropriate actions. In this paper, a method to build the appropriate prediction system is presented. First, it generates a data source of predictor variables from student dataset collected from a faculty of economic sciences in Beirut between 2010 and 2020. Then, it will build a prediction model using data classification techniques based on identified predictor variables and validate it. Using open-source software and free cloud environments, a prediction program was developed. It consolidates, corrects, and normalizes the student''s data. Then, it applies simple linear regression to show the correlation between the different variables and the student dropout, which allows us to select the factors that are highly correlated. From this point on, the program tries to predict the student dropout using different classification algorithms by machine learning on student dataset who left their courses either in success or in failure. Lastly, it measures the accuracy of the results and determines the best algorithm. In this study, the Artificial Neural Networks - Multilayer Perceptron showed an accuracy of 98.1% using only five variables. Finally, we evoke new avenues to further research and improve the model.
Student dropout is a serious issue in that it not only affects the individual students who drop out but also has negative impacts on the former university, family, and society together. To resolve this, various attempts have been made to predict student dropout using machine learning. This paper presents a model to predict student dropout at Sahmyook University using machine learning. Academic records collected from 20,050 students of the university were analyzed and used for learning. Various machine learning algorithms were used to implement the model, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Deep Neural Network, and LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), and their performances were compared through experiments. We also discuss the influence of oversampling used to resolve data imbalance issues in the dropout data. For this purpose, various oversampling algorithms such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and Borderline-SMOTE were tested. Our experimental results showed that the proposed model implemented using LightGBM provided the best performance with an F1-score of 0.840, which is higher than the results of previous studies discussing the dropout prediction with the issue of class imbalance.
Student dropout is a serious problem globally. It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students'' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students'' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students'' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student''s dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.
Student dropout, defined as the abandonment of a high education program before obtaining the degree without reincorporation, is a problem that affects every higher education institution in the world. This study uses machine learning models over two Chilean universities to predict first-year engineering student dropout over enrolled students, and to analyze the variables that affect the probability of dropout. The results show that instead of combining the datasets into a single dataset, it is better to apply a model per university. Moreover, among the eight machine learning models tested over the datasets, gradient-boosting decision trees reports the best model. Further analyses of the interpretative models show that a higher score in almost any entrance university test decreases the probability of dropout, the most important variable being the mathematical test. One exception is the language test, where a higher score increases the probability of dropout.
Student persistence is of great importance for all stakeholders in higher education. There have been numerous studies using data mining and machine learning tools to predict student persistence. However, very little research has explored individual feature importance and their distinctive roles in predicting individual outcomes. In this study, we compare the predictive performance of two widely used machine learning models, logistic regression, and random forest, and use the SMOTE to improve the model performance. We analyze the feature importance in both aggregated form and their varied impact on individual predictions using a real-world student persistence dataset. In the discussion section, we propose practical approaches for monitoring and predicting student persistence.
Student retention is a major challenge at American universities with the average six year graduation rate hovering around 59%. Among minority students the graduation rate drops to 46% for Blacks and 55% for Hispanics. Low graduation rates not only impact the financial well-being of individuals but the economy as a whole. Thus, improving student retention, in particular, minority student retention, is of paramount importance at institutions of higher education. This paper describes a machine learning approach to predicting minority native and transfer student dropout using a dataset from a four year Hispanic serving institution in the north eastern region of the United States with a large percentage of minority students. The results of the study show that standard machine learning models can predict minority transfer student dropout with a high degree of accuracy of 97% and minority native student dropout with an accuracy of 81%. The features that were most important in predicting minority transfer student dropout were SAT scores, and college cumulative GPA, while high school GPA and college cumulative GPA were the top predictors for minority native student dropout. This study demonstrates that educational institutions can use cost effective off-the-shelf standard machine learning models to achieve a high degree of accuracy in predicting minority student dropout. The high prediction accuracy achieved helps in reliably identifying at-risk minority students and providing them with necessary interventions to support their academic success.
Student retention is an essential part of many enrollment management systems. It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon.
Student retention is of the utmost importance to higher education institutions. It is a metric used by legislators, accreditation agencies, and governing bodies. Providing students with remedial assistance at the right time has often proven an effective method for student retention. Identifying students that require this type of support is usually cumbersome though. A variety of stakeholders, such as educators, counselors, advisors, and other staff members, may have to be involved in identifying students who are at-risk. Following recent developments in machine learning algorithms, automated systems may be developed to predict students'' performance and refer students to remedial instruction. This paper proposes the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict a student''s grades in a university course at any given semester based on the initial performance of the student in a combination of course assessment tools, such as quizzes, assignments, and tests. The prediction model is based on a dataset of real cases compiled from courses at a private university in Saudi Arabia. The model, however, is general enough to be applied to any course at universities around the world. The prediction classifiers used in this study are Random Forest (RF), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Linear Regression (LR), Additive Regression (AR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Various metrics are employed to measure the prediction models'' performance and assess the accuracy and validity of the proposed AI-based algorithms. Results indicate that the best classifier for predicting the final exam grade is the SMO, with a minimum mean absolute error of 2.350. The best prediction classifier for the midterm exam is LR with a minimum mean absolute error of 1.978. As tools for the early identification of students'' difficulties in the particular courses in which they are enrolled, the effectiveness of the proposed models is discussed.
Student retention is one main challenge faced by higher education institutions in Colombia. Over recent years, there has been an increasing trend of students dropping out of university for various academic, social, economic, institutional, or personal reasons. This has significant impacts on private higher education institutions, whose main livelihood depends on student numbers, with some institutions in a critical situation. In this paper, we design and implement a data analytics model that predicts the risk of dropout that students may present. The sources of information used to construct this model contain academic and socioeconomic variables, covering past academic periods to understand the problem in detail. Machine Learning approaches are used to determine the best model using the CRISP-DM methodology. This model is deployed via a decision-making tool for the academic counseling office, whose main objective is to maximize student retention.
Students learning performance is one of the core components for assessing any educational systems. Students performance is very crucial in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to improve education systems has led to the development of the field of research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings, allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years. Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure, dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods. The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to explore the relationship between these factors and GPA''s. For the classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different machine learning models on predicting student performance at early stages using different features including courses'' grades and admission tests'' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.
The Admission Point Score (APS) is used by most South African universities to identify a university programme in which a learner is likely to succeed. While the APS appears helpful to gauge the aptitude of a learner and predict their success, the reality is that between 2008 and 2015 almost 50% of learners who made the required APS for a Science programme failed to complete the requirements for that programme. This paper delineates and diagnoses learner vulnerability, using a learner attrition model, for early intervention and as an alternative to using the APS. The analysis shows that various predictive models achieve higher accuracy to predict learner vulnerability, by incorporating factors of the learner attrition model, rather than just using the APS score. This paper argues for a more complex view of predicting learner vulnerability for early interventions by incorporating the learner’s background, individual characteristics, and schooling data. It does not agree with the aggregation of National Senior Certificate (NSC) subjects into APS scores since this normalises the complexity of the subtle relations between the schooling system, learner attrition, and pre-schooling pedagogical dynamics. This paper points to a more nuanced view of predicting learner vulnerability.
The aim of this paper is to predict, on a purely algorithmic basis, students who are at risk of dropping out of university. Data used in this study originated from the University of Bari Aldo Moro, during 2013–16, and were provided by the Osservatorio Studenti-Didattica of Miur-Cineca. Data analysis is based solely on the information set available, for each student, inside the university information system. Predictions of individual dropouts have been carried out by means of suitable Machine Learning techniques, known as supervised classification algorithms.
The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the most frequently used research methods and factors influencing academic performance, based on a pool of 95 studies, published after 2012. We considered only peer-reviewed papers containing 78 empirical and 17 meta-analytic studies. Our theoretical background lies in the different approaches of the terms ‘university dropout’ and ‘academic performance’. After the systematic analysis we ascertained the most commonly used methods are Educational Data Mining (EDM) algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression and neural networks) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The strength of the predictive power depends on the dataset, however Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes algorithm were found to be the most precise in prediction. Regarding factors influencing academic performance we derived our results based on 600,000 university students. Considering the data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, reaching up to 900 studies, we found grade point average (GPA), obtained credits (ECTS) and gender to be the most consistent and decisive predictors of academic performance. Nevertheless, GPA and ECTS (as output variables) are mediated by student factors (intrinsic motivation, self-regulated learning strategies, self-efficacy, prior education) and throughput factors (work, finances, academic engagement). We had contradictory results on age and family background.
The application of intelligent systems in the higher education sector is an active field of research, powered by the abundance of available data and by the urgency to define effective, data-driven strategies to overcome students’ dropout and improve students’ academic performance. This work applies machine learning techniques to develop prediction models that can contribute to the early detection of students at risk of dropping out or not finishing their degree in due time. It also evaluates the best moment for performing the prediction along the student’s enrollment year. The models are built on data of undergraduate students from a Polytechnic University in Portugal, enrolled between 2009 and 2017, comprising academic, social–demographic, and macroeconomic information at three different phases during the first academic year of the students. Five machine learning algorithms are used to train prediction models at each phase, and the most relevant features for the top performing models are identified. Results show that the best models use Random Forest, either incorporating strategies to deal with the imbalanced nature of the data or using such strategies at the data level. The best results are obtained at the end of the first semester, when some information about the academic performance after enrollment is already available. The overall results compare fairly with some similar works that address the early prediction of students’ dropout or academic performance.
The core of dropout prediction lies in the selection of predictive models and feature tables. Machine learning models have been shown to predict student dropouts accurately. Because students may drop out of school in any semester, the student history data recorded in the academic management system would have a different length. The different length of student history data poses a challenge for generating feature tables. Most current studies predict student dropouts in the first academic year and therefore avoid discussing this issue. The central assumption of these studies is that more than 50% of dropouts will leave school in the first academic year. However, in our study, we found the distribution of dropouts is evenly distributed in all academic years based on the dataset from a Korean university. This result suggests that Korean students’ data characteristics included in our dataset may differ from those of other developed countries. More specifically, the result that dropouts are evenly distributed throughout the academic years indicates the importance of a dropout prediction for the students in any academic year. Based on this, we explore the universal feature tables applicable to dropout prediction for university students in any academic year. We design several feature tables and compare the performance of six machine learning models on these feature tables. We find that the mean value-based feature table exhibits better generalization, and the model based on the gradient boosting technique performs better than other models. This result reveals the importance of students’ historical information in predicting dropout.
The early identification of college students at risk of dropout is of great interest and importance all over the world, since the early leaving of higher education is associated with considerable personal and social costs. In Hungary, especially in STEM undergraduate programs, the dropout rate is particularly high, much higher than the EU average. In this work, using advanced machine learning models such as deep neural networks and gradient boosted trees, we aim to predict the final academic performance of students at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The dropout prediction is based on the data that are available at the time of enrollment. In addition to the predictions, we also interpret our machine learning models with the help of state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values. The accuracy and AUC of the best-performing deep learning model are 72.4% and 0.771, respectively that slightly outperforms XGBoost, the cutting-edge benchmark model for tabular data.
The examination of student attrition within higher education is a dynamic field that seeks to tackle the complex task of preventing dropout occurrences and formulating effective retention strategies. This challenge becomes particularly pertinent within the realm of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In the pursuit of these objectives, this research endeavors to assess prevailing data mining methodologies, specifically focusing on Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - all of which are widely employed for the prediction of student attrition. The study is conducted on a comprehensive dataset encompassing engineering students from a prominent Mexican university, with a specific emphasis on the application of variable selection through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and addressing class imbalance via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The outcomes of this investigation conspicuously identify Random Forest as the most optimal predictive model, yielding an impressive accuracy rate of 98%. Additionally, the research underscores the effectiveness of RFE in discerning influential variables. Furthermore, to provide complex insights and decision support, the study harnesses the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to expound upon the factors that wield significant impact. This multifaceted analysis contributes to the advancement of strategies for enhancing student retention within STEM disciplines.
The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (FME) faces a significant student drop-out in the first-year bachelor programme, which is an actual problem for many higher education institutions. Metacognitive processes play a vital role in self-regulated learning. Students become active participants in their learning, and one critical aspect of higher education studies is planning and time management. The exam taking behaviour is in the context of the FME manifestation of the time management skills of each student; thus, the exam-taking patterns may help identify at-risk students. To evaluate the importance of exam behaviour patterns, we conducted three experiments. Identification of students passing or failing the first study year has been conducted using four different machine learning models. The exam taking behaviour patterns increase the prediction F-measure significantly for the class of failing students (approximately 0.3 increase). Moreover, the approach based on student behaviour enabled us to identify the critical exam-taking patterns, which further helps the lecturers identify at-risk students and improve their time management skills and chances to pass the first academic year.
The low birth rate in Taiwan has led to a severe challenge for many universities to enroll a sufficient number of students. Consequently, a large number of students have been admitted to universities regardless of whether they have an aptitude for academic studies. Early diagnosis of students with a high dropout risk enables interventions to be provided early on, which can help these students to complete their studies, graduate, and enhance their future competitiveness in the workplace. Effective prelearning interventions are necessary, therefore students’ learning backgrounds should be thoroughly examined. This study investigated how big data and artificial intelligence can be used to help universities to more precisely understand student backgrounds, according to which corresponding interventions can be provided. For this study, 3552 students from a university in Taiwan were sampled. A statistical learning method and a machine learning method based on deep neural networks were used to predict their probability of dropping out. The results revealed that student academic performance (regarding the dynamics of class ranking percentage), student loan applications, the number of absences from school, and the number of alerted subjects successfully predicted whether or not students would drop out of university with an accuracy rate of 68% when the statistical learning method was employed, and 77% for the deep learning method, in the case of giving first priority to the high sensitivity in predicting dropouts. However, when the specificity metric was preferred, then the two approaches both reached more than 80% accuracy rates. These results may enable the university to provide interventions to students for assisting course selection and enhancing their competencies based on their aptitudes, potentially reducing the dropout rate and facilitating adaptive learning, thereby achieving a win-win situation for both the university and the students. This research offers a feasible direction for using artificial intelligence applications on the basis of a university’s institutional research database.
The objective of this research is to reduce the dropout rate of students in the Faculty of Systems Engineering and Informatics of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (FISI-UNMSM), through the implementation of an intelligent system with a data mining approach and the autonomous learning algorithm (decision trees) that predicts which students are at risk of dropping out. It was developed in Python and the free software Weka. For this, the data of the students who entered the faculty from 2004 to 2014 have been considered. This solution increases the availability and the level of satisfaction of the faculty; in the learning process, an accuracy percentage of 90.34% and precision of 95.91% was obtained, so the data mining model is considered valid. In addition, it was found that the variables that most influenced students in making the decision to abandon their studies are the historical weighted average their grades, the weighted average their grades of the last cycle, and the number of credits of their approved courses
The prediction of students'' academic performance is an area of great concern for universities and educational institutions since academic performance is one of the most important aspects of the learning process. To analyze this behavior, this study makes a critical analysis of the topic of interest and aims to review, analyze and summarize the latest research advances related to the prediction of academic performance. The systematic literature review method is applied to answer three questions: (1) What factors are determinants in predicting students'' academic performance? (2) what methods are used to predict students'' academic performance? and (3) what are the objectives and interests in predicting students'' academic performance? After conducting the study of 50 outstanding articles, as results, we found that academic factor is the guideline for predicting academic performance; supervised machine learning is the most used technique, highlighting support vector machine, random forests, and neural networks; the most outstanding objectives for the application of prediction were: Student performance with 53%, risk of failure with 14%, search for student knowledge with 12%, avoid dropout with 12%, and decision making with 10%
The prevention of students dropping out is considered very important in many educational institutions. In this paper we describe the results of an educational data analytics case study focused on detection of dropout of System Engineering (SE) undergraduate students after 7 years of enrollment in a Colombian university. Original data is extended and enriched using a feature engineering process. Our experimental results showed that simple algorithms achieve reliable levels of accuracy to identify predictors of dropout. Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes results were compared in order to propose the best option. Also, Watson Analytics is evaluated to establish the usability of the service for a non expert user. Main results are presented in order to decrease the dropout rate by identifying potential causes. In addition, we present some findings related to data quality to improve the students data collection process.

The purpose of this study was to predict students dropping out of the Education Management Doctoral Program of FKIP Mulawarman University and to evaluate the Extreme Learning Machine in predicting student dropouts. This research uses the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm, the feedforward neural network learning method and the Support Vector Machine algorithm for comparison of the level of accuracy using the same data. The data used is as much as 110 data according to the number of students from the class of 2012 to 2018, the data is taken from the SIA Education Management Study Program of the Mulawarman University Doctoral Program and then processed. In this case, how to predict student dropouts using the variable Gender, Semester 3 IP Value, Working Status, Family Status, Age, and using two DO and NON DO Classes? And calculating the accuracy value using a confusion matrix ?. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that students drop out in the Educational Management of the FKIP Mulawarman University Doctoral Program can be predicted by Extreme Learning Machine using the training value obtained from semester 3 of the 2012-2018 class. From the results of testing the predictive accuracy of the Extreme Learning Machine is 72 %.
The results of the research project that aims to identify patterns of student dropout from socioeconomic, academic, disciplinary and institutional data of students from undergraduate programs at the University of Narinõ from Pasto city (Colombia), using data mining techniques are presented. Built a data repository with the records of students who were admitted in the period from the first half of 2004 and the second semester of 2006. Three complete cohorts were analyzed with an observation period of six years until 2011. Socioeconomic and academic student dropout profiles were discovered using classification technique based on decision trees. The knowledge generated will support effective decision-making of university staff focused to develop policies and strategies related to student retention programs that are currently set.
The rising trend of students dropping out of universities without completing their degrees is becoming a concerning issue for institutions. To address this problem, the reasons behind this phenomenon need to be explored. However, most educational data sets have small sample sizes and varying patterns. Currently, there are few machine learning approaches for Pakistani higher education student performance. This study presents a machine learning-based approach to predict student withdrawals and identify the reasons behind them. The proposed approach compares two supervised ML algorithms, K-N earestNeighbors (KNN) and Decision-Tree (DT). The most important attributes affecting student retention are also determined using the ExtraTreesClassifier ensemble learning algorithm. In our experimental evaluation, the accuracy of KNN was 75%, and 70% for DT.
The student dropout rate in universities is fascinating, especially among the students of Electrical Engineering. Even the most developed European countries face 40% to 50% dropout rate of engineering students during their first year, and the rate can be as high as 80% for some engineering disciplines. This problem calls attention of educators and university administration to take measures which can help in the reduction of the dropout rate and assist students in successfully completing their degree. Among many other solutions to control the student dropout rate, one is the adoption of a prediction mechanism whereby students can be warned about their potentially poor performance so that they can improve their performance resulting in better grades. Most of the existing prediction mechanisms apply various machine learning techniques on student cognitive features. In addition, non-cognitive features also have significant impact on students'' performance; however, they have been sparsely applied for prediction. This research aims at improving the existing prediction mechanism by exploiting both cognitive and non-cognitive features of students for predicting their results. It has been found in the result analysis that addition of cognitive features increases prediction accuracies of decision tree; however, the addition does not play a significant role in other techniques. The study also identified the individual cognitive features that should be considered by students and universities to cater for drop outs.
The study aims to compare the performance of various machine learning models for student persistence prediction. The research starts with a historical review of student retention studies and the evolution of predictive models in the field. It highlights the importance of predicting student persistence for educational institutions and individuals. It then describes a dataset from ResearchGate, consisting of anonymized undergraduate student data collected between 2008 and 2018, with 37 features and 4,424 records. Ten machine learning algorithms are considered, with two popular machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classification, being compared in more detail for their performance in predicting student persistence. Evaluation metrics such as prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used. Results show that the Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression in predicting student outcomes, particularly when using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance. Overall, this study contributes to student retention research and provides insights for developing targeted support measures to enhance student success in higher education.
There is a growing concern around student attrition worldwide, including South African universities. More often than not, the reasons for students not completing their degree in the allocated time frame include academic reasons, socio-pschyo factors, and lack of effective transition from the secondary education system to the tertiary education systems. To overcome these challenges, the tertiary educational institutions endeavor to implement interventions geared toward academic success. One of the challenges, however, is identifying the vulnerable students in a timely manner. This study therefore aims to predict student performance by using a learner attrition model so that the vulnerable students are identified early on in the academic year and are provided support through effective interventions, thereby impacting student success positively. Predictive machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and logistic regression, were trained to deduce the students into four risk-profiles. A random forest outperformed other classifiers in predicting at-risk student profiles with an accuracy of 85%, kappa statistic of 0.7, and an AUC of 0.95. This research argues for a more complex view of predicting vulnerable learners by including the student''s background, individual, and schooling attributes.
This paper combines a theoretical-based model with a data-driven approach to develop an Early Warning System that detects students who are more likely to dropout. The model uses innovative multilevel statistical and machine learning methods. The paper demonstrates the validity of the approach by applying it to administrative data from a leading Italian university.
This paper identifies key research on the factors that help to explain university dropout and how these factors are being explored by means of artificial intelligence (AI). The study describes the methodology employed to select 31 papers from a repository of 2,745 reported in the literature. The analysis centered on the main AI methods used and four categories of explanatory factors of university dropout: academic factors; factors associated with motivation and study habits; institutional factors; and economic and sociodemographic factors. The conclusion drawn from this literature review is that AI is most commonly used for decision tree-based classification, and most studies focus on predicting university dropout on the basis of explanatory factors.
This paper presents a case study of applying the data science methods to a large education data collected at a University over 7 years. The goal of the study is to understand the important features, and to derive models for predicting student retention. Issues dealing with real world data, for example variable definition, missing data handling, and data cleaning were discussed. A new recursive feature elimination based feature selection method was developed. This study derived features and models for four different student groups, the first-generation students, the African American students, the Hispanic students, and the disabled students. The features identified and the predictive models built were compared crossed the four groups.
This paper presents an analysis of data about the drop out of undergraduate engineering students at the University of Brasilia(UnB), Brazil. In Brazil, similar to other countries, there is a representative amount of engineering students that enroll in engineering majors, however, they don''t get to graduate in those majors. Information about the reason for that phenomenon is important for action on the matter by university decisionmakers. This paper aims to answer the research question: What are the main factors that motivate engineering students to drop out of engineering majors at UnB? We have collected the social and performance data of engineering students from 2009 to 2019. Some of the data can be considered rare in similar studies, like students'' distance from home to campus and factors like students'' leave of absence requests rather than performance factors. We used three data mining techniques: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Boosting algorithm (GBM) and Random Forest(RF). The results of the study showed that international students deserve some attention from the university and courses like Physics 1 can be challenging for engineering students.
This research investigates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict first year student retention rates. Based on a significant body of previous research, this work expands on previous attempts to predict student outcomes using machinelearning techniques. Using a large data set provided by Columbus State University''s Information Technology department, ANNs were used to analyze incoming first-year traditional freshmen students'' data over a period from 2005-2011. Using several different network designs, the students'' data was analyzed, and a basic predictive network was devised. While the overall accuracy was high when including the first and second semesters worth of data, once the data set was reduced to a single semester, the overall accuracy dropped significantly. Using different network designs, more complex learning algorithms, and better training strategies, the prediction accuracy rate for a student''s return to the second year approached 75% overall. Since the rate is still low, there is room for improvements, and several techniques that might increase the reliability of these networks are discussed. Copyright 2013 ACM.
This research is dedicated to the problem of transforming lineareducational systems of higher education institutions into a new paradigm of person-centered, blended and individual education. This paper investigates role, application, and challenges of applying AI to predict the academic performance traditional of students: dropouts, GPA, publication activity and other indicators to decrease dropouts and make the learning process more personalized and adaptive. In the first part, we overview the process of data mining using internal university''s resources (LMS and other systems) and open source data from students'' social networks. Such an aggregation allows describing each student by socio-demographic and psychometric features. Further, we demonstrate how we can dynamically monitor students'' activities during the learning process to supplement the resulting features. In the second part of our research, we propose various static and dynamic targets for predictive models and demonstrate the results of predictions and comparisons of several predictive models. The research is based on the information on data processing of more than 20000 students in 2013-2019.
This study analyzes the performance of four machine learning algorithms with different perspectives for defining data files, in the prediction of university student desertion. The algorithms used were: Random Forest, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression. It was found that the Random Forest algorithm with 10 variables randomly sampled as candidates in each division, was the best for predicting dropouts and that the ideal perspective for training the algorithm is to use information on all semesters that students take within a given period of time, using a classification variable that defines the non-dropout as the graduated student. In a first validation sample, this approach correctly predicted 91% of dropouts, with a sensitivity of 87%.
This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for early prediction of student performance in higher education institutions. Using the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, various models, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Ensemble Model, were employed to predict student performance in three categories: Pass/Fail, Close to Fail, and Close to Pass. The Ensemble Model (EM) consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest overall F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. These results highlight the potential of data-driven techniques in informing educational stakeholders’ decision-making processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating personalized learning strategies tailored to students’ needs. By identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications, including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic excellence. Future research aims to investigate the impact of individual activities on student performance and explore day-to-day student behaviors, enabling the creation of tailored pedagogical policies and guidelines.
To successfully reduce student attrition, it is imperative to understand what the underlying determinants of attrition are and which students are at risk of dropping out. We develop an early detection system (EDS) using administrative student data from a state and private university to predict student dropout as a basis for a targeted intervention. To create an EDS that can be used in any German university, we use the AdaBoost Algorithm to combine regression analysis, neural networks, and decision trees - instead of relying on only one specific method. Prediction accuracy at the end of the first semester is 79% for the state university and 85% for the private university of applied sciences. After the fourth semester, the accuracy improves to 90% for the state university and 95% for the private university of applied sciences.
University dropout is a problem that not only affects students, but also families, universities, society, and others. This problem has a global character, so it is common to identify it in different parts of the world. However, there are few solutions that efficiently take advantage of available technology and information. Therefore, this study implements a predictive analysis model to identify students at risk of dropout in Peruvian universities and the variables that influence it. For this purpose, the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP - DM) methodology is used to develop the model and four Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology consists of five phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The experiment was carried out by conducting a survey to 385 students from different public and private universities in Peru, where cognitive, affective, family environment, pre-university, career and university variables were considered. The results showed that the most influential variables in the prediction of university dropout were ''age'', ''term'' and the student''s ''financing method''. We also found that the Random Forest algorithm obtained the best performance, with an AUC of 0.9623 in the prediction of college dropout.
University dropout is a very complex problem that affects the Government, Institutions and students and families in the world. The prediction allows to identify the students who are going to desert early, so that the directors of the Universities can establish strategies to mitigate it. Machine Learning methods are the most recent and effective for this problem. However, so far these methods have been applied independently and not in combination. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on decision trees and neural networks, designed following the KDD methodology, to predict with high precision the university student dropout. The proposal was implemented in Rapid Miner Studio 6.4 and applied to a dataset with 1761 student records and 53 variables for training. Through a variable selection procedure that includes 8 algorithms, 27 variables were selected. The results on 100 new records show an accuracy of 87%, 91%, 98% for decision tree models, neural networks and stacking respectively. In addition, the result of sensitivity is 90.6%, 93.3%, 98.7% for decision trees, neural networks and stacking respectively. Regarding specificity, 76%, 84% and 96% have been obtained for decision trees, neural networks and stacking respectively. The results of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity also show that the hybrid model presents better results than the separate models..
University dropout rates are a problem that presents many negative consequences. It is an academic issue and carries an unfavorable economic impact. In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to the early detection of students likely to drop out. This paper uses data corresponding to dropout candidates after their first year in the third largest face-to-face university in Europe, with the goal of predicting likely dropout either at the beginning of the course of study or at the end of the first semester. In this prediction, we considered the five major program areas. Different techniques have been used: first, a Feature Selection Process in order to identify the variables more correlated with dropout; then, some Machine Learning Models (Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks) as well as a Logistic Regression. The results show that dropout detection does not work only with enrollment variables, but it improves after the first semester results. Academic performance is always a relevant variable, but there are others, such as the level of preference that the student had over the course that he or she was finally able to study. The success of the techniques depends on the program areas. Machine Learning obtains the best results, but a simple Logistic Regression model can be used as a reasonable baseline.
Using data mining methods, this paper presents a new means of identifying freshmen''s profiles likely to face major difficulties to complete their first academic year. Academic failure is a relevant issue at a time when post-secondary education is ever more critical to economic success. We aim at early detection of potential failure using student data available at registration, i.e. school records and environmental factors, with a view to timely and efficient remediation and/or study reorientation. We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artificial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different fields. Real data pertaining to undergraduates at the University of Liège (Belgium), illustrates our methodology.
Using machine learning to predict students’ dropout in higher education institutions and programs has proven to be effective in many use cases. In an approach based on machine learning algorithms to detect students at risk of dropout, there are three main factors: the choice of features likely to influence a partial or total stop of the student, the choice of the algorithm to implement a prediction model, and the choice of the evaluation metrics to monitor and assess the credibility of the results. This paper aims to provide a diagnosis of machine learning techniques used to detect students’ dropout in higher education programs, a critical analysis of the limitations of the models proposed in the literature, as well as the major contribution of this article is to present recommendations that may resolve the lack of global model that can be generalized in all the higher education institutions at least in the same country or in the same university.
Utilizing a dataset sourced from a higher education institution, this study aims to assess the efficacy of diverse machine learning algorithms in predicting student dropout and academic success. Our focus was on algorithms capable of effectively handling imbalanced data. To tackle class imbalance, we employed the SMOTE resampling technique. We applied a range of algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), as well as boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost (CB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LB). To enhance the models'' performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. Additionally, we employed the Isolation Forest (IF) method to identify outliers or anomalies within the dataset. Notably, our findings indicate that boosting algorithms, particularly LightGBM and CatBoost with Optuna, outperformed traditional classification methods. Our study''s generalizability to other contexts is constrained due to its reliance on a single dataset, with inherent limitations. Nevertheless, this research provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout and academic success. By benchmarking these algorithms, our project offers guidance to both researchers and practitioners in their choice of suitable approaches for similar predictive tasks.
We perform two approaches of machine learning, logistic regressions and decision trees, to predict student dropout at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The models are computed on the basis of examination data, i.e. data available at all universities without the need of specific collection. Therefore, we propose a methodical approach that may be put in practice with relative ease at other institutions. We find decision trees to produce slightly better results than logistic regressions. However, both methods yield high prediction accuracies of up to 95% after three semesters. A classification with more than 83% accuracy is already possible after the first semester.
We will also derive practical solutions using predictive analytics. And this would include application making predictions with real world example from University of Faculty of Chariaa of Fez. As soon as student enrolled to the university, they will certainly encounter many difficulties and problems which discourage their motivation towards their courses and which pushes them to leave their university. The aim of our article is to manage an investigation of the issue of dropping out their studies. This investigation actively integrates the benefits ofmachine learning. Hence, we will concentrate on two fundamental strategies which are KNN, which depends on the idea of likeness among data; and the famous strategy SVM, which can break the issues of classification. Thanks to predictive analytics, we can come up concrete solutions to decrease this issue. Therefore, our case study was specifically limited to University of Chariaa-Fez, Morocco.
When facing a classification problem, data science practitioners must search through an armory of methods. Often, practitioners are tempted to use off-the-shelf classifiers, including automated Machine Learning (AutoML) toolboxes; however, stand-alone classifiers are not applicable to every problem and AutoML may be time-consuming raising up environment-ethical issues. To magnify the problem, (commercial) AutoML toolboxes are black and practitioners are not allowed to extend them with new methods to improve their classification performance. Our main objective is to show that an off-the-shelf classifier designed for class imbalance problems can achieve similar performance to an AutoML toolbox. To do so, first, we present the student dropout prediction case study, which most off-the-shelf classifiers find difficult to solve due to the problem''s inherent class imbalance. We show that Microsoft Azure AutoML outperforms several popular, stand-alone classifiers. However, multivariate PBC4cip, an off-the-shelf classifier especially designed to deal with class imbalance, yields results that are just as good as Microsoft Azure AutoML, with the advantage that the expensive steps of mechanism selection and tuning are avoided. Our studies show that data science practitioners need to build themselves a taxonomy of classification mechanisms in terms of the properties of the problem to solve. Additionally, AutoML platforms should let scientists modify the armory of classifiers and provide an explanation of both mechanism selection and mechanism tunning so that practitioners learn further lessons.
With pressure to increase graduation rates and reduce time to degree in higher education, it is important to identify at-risk students early. Automated early warning systems are therefore highly desirable. In this paper, we use unsupervised clustering techniques to predict the graduation status of declared majors in five departments at California State University Northridge (CSUN), based on a minimal number of lower division courses in each major. In addition, we use the detected clusters to identify hidden bottleneck courses.
