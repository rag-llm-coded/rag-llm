Often, practitioners are tempted to use off-the-shelf classifiers, including automated Machine Learning (AutoML) toolboxes; however, stand-alone classifiers are not applicable to every problem and AutoML may be time-consuming raising up environment-ethical issues. To magnify the problem, (commercial) AutoML toolboxes are black and practitioners are not allowed to extend them with new methods to improve their classification performance. Our main objective is to show that an off-the-shelf classifier designed for class imbalance problems can achieve similar performance to an AutoML toolbox. To do so, first, we present the student dropout prediction case study, which most off-the-shelf classifiers find difficult to solve due to the problem's inherent class imbalance. We show that Microsoft Azure AutoML outperforms several popular, stand-alone classifiers. However, multivariate PBC4cip, an off-the-shelf classifier especially designed to deal with class imbalance, yields results that are just as good as Microsoft Azure AutoML, with the advantage that the expensive steps of mechanism selection and tuning are avoided. Our studies show that data science practitioners need to build themselves a taxonomy of classification mechanisms in terms of the properties of the problem to solve. Additionally, AutoML platforms should let scientists modify the armory of classifiers and provide an explanation of both mechanism selection and mechanism tunning so that practitioners learn further lessons. © 2013 IEEE.",Automated machine learning; feature selection; imbalanced classification models; student drop out; supervised classification,Automation; Classification (of information); Feature Selection; Forecasting; Job analysis; Problem solving; Automated machine learning; Automated machines; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Drop-out; Features extraction; Features selection; Imbalanced classification; Imbalanced classification model; Machine-learning; Null value; Student drop out; Supervised classification; Support vectors machine; Task analysis; Support vector machines,"Waring J., Lindvall C., Umeton R., Automated machine learning: Review of the state-of-the-art and opportunities for healthcare, Artif.

Still, the terminology and methodology vary significantly across existing studies, and the implications of different modeling decisions are not fully understood. This study provides a systematic evaluation of contributing factors and predictive performance of machine learning models over time and across different student groups. Drawing on twelve years of administrative data at a large public university in the US, we find that dropout prediction at the end of the second year has a 20% higher AUC than at the time of enrollment in a Random Forest model. Also, most predictive factors at the time of enrollment, including demographics and high school performance, are quickly superseded in predictive importance by college performance and in later stages by enrollment behavior. Regarding variability across student groups, college GPA has more predictive value for students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds than their peers. These results can help researchers and administrators understand the comparative value of different data sources when building early warning systems and optimizing decisions under specific policy goals. © 2024 Owner/Author.",administrative data;

The first analysis looks at goal value distributions, economic variables, and student counts by gender. The handling of outliers, feature selection, and class imbalance are all addressed by further filtering. Using ROC curves to highlight classification strength, the study assesses several classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. With the greatest AUC of 0.99, Random Forest remarkably shows excellent predictive power, closely followed by XGBoost at 0.98. XGBoost performs exceptionally well on testing and training datasets. The findings contribute valuable insights into predictive modeling for understanding and predicting student outcomes, emphasizing the potential to enhance educational support systems. This integrated approach, combining exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, establishes a robust framework for future research in educational data mining and predictive analytics.  © 2024 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.",Class Imbalance;

This challenge becomes particularly pertinent within the realm of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In the pursuit of these objectives, this research endeavors to assess prevailing data mining methodologies, specifically focusing on Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - all of which are widely employed for the prediction of student attrition. The study is conducted on a comprehensive dataset encompassing engineering students from a prominent Mexican university, with a specific emphasis on the application of variable selection through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and addressing class imbalance via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The outcomes of this investigation conspicuously identify Random Forest as the most optimal predictive model, yielding an impressive accuracy rate of 98%. Additionally, the research underscores the effectiveness of RFE in discerning influential variables. Furthermore, to provide complex insights and decision support, the study harnesses the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to expound upon the factors that wield significant impact. This multifaceted analysis contributes to the advancement of strategies for enhancing student retention within STEM disciplines. © 2023 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

As important drivers for student retention and learning success, generative AI-tools like translators, paraphrasers and most lately chatbots can support students in their learning processes. The perceptions and expectations of first-years students related to AI-tools have not yet been researched in-depth. The same can be stated about necessary requirements and skills for the purposeful use of AI-tools. The research work examines the relationship between first-year students’ knowledge, skills and attitudes and their use of AI-tools for their learning processes. Analysing the data of 634 first-year students revealed that attitudes towards AI significantly explains the intended use of AI tools. Additionally, the perceived benefits of AI-technology are predictors for students’ perception of AI-robots as cooperation partners for humans. Educators in higher education must facilitate students’ AI competencies and integrate AI-tools into instructional designs. As a result, students learning processes will be improved. © The Author(s) 2024.",AI tool; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; Higher education; Learning process,,"Aksnes D.W., Langfeldt L., Wouters P., Citations, citation indicators, and research quality: An overview of basic concepts and theories, SAGE Open, 9, 1, (2019); Alamri H.A., Watson S., Watson W., Learning technology models that support personalization within blended learning environments in higher education, TechTrends, 65, 1, pp. 62-78, (2021); Aldowah H., Al-Samarraie H., Fauzy W.M., Educational data mining and learning analytics for 21st century higher education: a review and synthesis, Telematics and Informatics, 37, pp. 13-49, (2019); Almaraz-Lopez C., Almaraz-Menendez F., Lopez-Esteban C., Comparative study of the attitudes and perceptions of university students in business administration and management and in education toward artificial intelligence, Education Sciences, 13, 6, (2023); Azevedo R., Bouchet F., Duffy M., Harley J., Taub M., Trevors G., Cloude E., Dever D., Wiedbusch M., Wortha F., Cerezo R., Lessons learned and future directions of metaTutor: leveraging multichannel data to scaffold self-regulated learning with an intelligent tutoring system, Frontiers in Psychology, (2022); Barrie S.C., A conceptual framework for the teaching and learning of generic graduate attributes, Studies in Higher Education, 32, 4, pp. 439-458, (2007); Bates T., Cobo C., Marino O., Wheeler S., Can artificial intelligence transform higher education?, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); Bean J.P., Eaton S.B., A Psychological Model of College Student Retention., (2020); Bhargava A., Bester M., Bolton L., Employees’ perceptions of the implementation of robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation (RAIA) on job satisfaction, job security, and employability, Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science, 6, 1, pp. 106-113, (2021); Borte K., Nesje K., Lillejord S., Barriers to student active learning in higher education, Teaching in Higher Education, 28, 3, pp. 597-615, (2023); Bozkurt A., Sharma R., Generative AI and prompt engineering: The art of whispering to let the genie out of the algorithmic world., 18, pp. vii-vi, (2023); Brusilovsky P., AI in education, learner control, and human-AI collaboration, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, (2023); Byrd K., Fan A., Her E., Liu Y., Almanza B., Leitch S., Robot vs human: Expectations, performances and gaps in off-premise restaurant service modes, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 33, 11, pp. 3996-4016, (2021); Cabero-Almenara J., Gutierrez-Castillo J.J., Guillen-Gamez F.D., Gaete-Bravo A.F., Digital Competence of Higher Education Students as a Predictor of Academic Success, Technology, Knowledge and Learning, 28, 2, pp. 683-702, (2023); Celik I., Dindar M., Muukkonen H., Jarvela S., The promises and challenges of artificial intelligence for teachers: A systematic review of research, TechTrends, 66, 4, pp. 616-630, (2022); Chan C.K.Y., A comprehensive AI policy education framework for university teaching and learning, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 20, 1, (2023); Chong T., Yu T., Keeling D.I., de Ruyter K., AI-chatbots on the services frontline addressing the challenges and opportunities of agency, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 63, (2021); Crisp G., Palmer E., Turnbull D., Nettelbeck T., Ward L., LeCouteur A., Sarris A., Strelan P., Schneider L., First year student expectations: Results from a university-wide student survey, Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice, 6, 1, pp. 16-32, (2009); Dang J., Liu L., Implicit theories of the human mind predict competitive and cooperative responses to AI robots, Computers in Human Behavior, 134, (2022); Desaire H., Chua A.E., Isom M., Jarosova R., Hua D., Distinguishing academic science writing from humans or ChatGPT with over 99% accuracy using off-the-shelf machine learning tools, Cell Reports Physical Science, 4, 6, (2023); Diakopoulos N., Friedler S., Arenas M., Et al., Principles for accountable algorithms and a social impact statement for algorithms, FATML, (2016); Ehlers U., Kellermann S.A., Future Skills - The Future of Learning andHigher education, Results of the International Future Skills Delphi Survey, (2019); Einola K., Khoreva V., Best friend or broken tool?

The contribution of this research lies in 1) comparing the relative importance of LMS (Moodle) data with transcript and demographic data in degree program dropout prediction, 2) examining the predictive importance of different data features monthly as a function of time from enrollment, hence extending the prior end-of-semester research to a midsemester analysis, and 3) measuring the prediction performance of the models monthly. The results identify “accumulated credits” (transcript) the “number of failed courses” (transcript), and “Moodle activity count” (LMS) as the most important features, suggesting LMS has significant predictive power and should be considered alongside transcript and demographic data when predicting degree program dropouts. Moreover, we visualize how these factors' importance and prediction performance vary over time, revealing general longitudinal trends and fluctuations within semesters. Finally, we elaborate upon this study's contributions before highlighting its limitations. © 2024 The Authors",Data analysis; Higher education; Learning management systems; Machine learning; Student dropout prediction,Finland; Education computing; Information management; Machine learning; Population statistics; Students; Degree program; Demographic data; Empirical studies; Finnish; High educations; Learning management system; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Prediction performance; Student dropout prediction; educational development; higher education; machine learning; student; Forecasting,"Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: a theoretical synthesis of recent research, Rev.

Therefore, there is a need of a mechanism to find students who might be susceptible to leave their studies. The research paper focuses on minimising the occurrences of university dropouts in higher educational institutions by identifying students who maybe at a higher chance of failing in the university path. The research employs a dataset acquired from an institute, encompassing information that was accessible at the beginning of students' enrollment, including their university background, demographic characteristics, and socio-economic circumstances. The dataset consists of Target variable categorized into Graduate, Dropout and Enrolled classes. The important features with respect to Target variable were extracted for building the model. The model is built using the observations of Graduate and Dropout class in the dataset for constructing the model and then classify the Enrolled class students into Graduate and Dropout class. Eight machine learning algorithms were deployed for building the model and best algorithm was selected for classification of the enrolled students. These findings would enable university administration to deploy prompt assistance programmes to aid the currently enrolled students which are likely to dropout in future in order to minimize the number of dropouts in university.  © 2024 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.",Classification; Dropouts; Higher Education; Machine Learning,Education computing; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Students; Binary classification; Dropout; Educational institutions; High educations; Higher education institutions; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Research papers; Student enrollments; Student retention; Classification (of information),"Beaulac C., Rosenthal J.S., Predicting University Students' Academic Success and Major Using Random Forests, Research in Higher Education, 60, 7, pp. 1048-1064, (2019); Migueis V., Freitas A., Garcia P.J., Silva A., Early segmentation of students according to their academic performance: A predictive modelling approach, Decision Support Systems, 115, pp. 36-51, (2018); Martins M.V., Tolledo D., MacHado J., Baptista L.M.T., Realinho V., Early Prediction of student's Performance in Higher Education: A Case Study, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2021); Romero C., Ventura S., Educational datamining: A review of the state of the art, Ieee Trans.

Although several IL standards and assessments have been developed for secondary and higher education, there is still no agreement about the possible associations between IL and both academic achievement and student dropout rates. In this article, we present a dataset including IL competences measurements, as well as academic achievement and socioeconomic indicators for 153 Chilean first- and second-year engineering students. The dataset is intended to allow researchers to use machine learning methods to study to what extent, if any, IL and academic achievement are related.

Using a machine learning approach, results from a sample of 609 first-year students from a continental European university show that early warnings from accounting courses are strongly predictive of first-year progression, and more so than data available at the start of the first year. In addition, the further the student is along their journey of the first undergraduate year, the more predictive the accounting engagement and performance data becomes for the prediction of programme progression outcomes. Our study contributes to the study of early warning signals for dropout through machine learning in accounting education, suggests implications for accounting educators, and provides useful pointers for further research in this area. © 2022 The Author(s).

Clustering algorithms and classification methods were tested to determine the predictive power of several variables regarding the dropout phenomenon on an unbalanced database of 14,495 undergraduate students with a real dropout rate of 8.5% and a retention rate of 91.5%. The usual classification criterion that assigns individuals to a class if their probability of belonging to it is greater than 50% provided accuracies of 13.2% in the dropout prediction and 99.4% in the retention prediction. Among eight classifiers, Random Forest was selected and applied along with Threshold Probability, which allowed us to gradually increase the dropout precision to more than 50%, while maintaining retention and global precisions above 70%. Through this study, it was found that the main variables associated with student dropouts were their academic performance during the early weeks of the first semester, their average grade in the previous academic levels, the previous mathematics score, and the entrance exam score. Other important variables were the number of class hours being taken, student age, funding status of scholarships, English level, and the number of dropped subjects in the early weeks. Given the trade-off between dropout and retention precisions, our results can guide educational institutions to focus on the most appropriate academic support strategies to help students at real risk of dropping out.

However, the black-box nature of many such models allows only to quantify uncertainty through ad hoc superstructures, which require to develop and train a model in an uncertainty-aware fashion. However, for applications where previously trained models are already in operation, it would be interesting to develop uncertainty quantification approaches acting as lightweight “plug-ins” that can be applied on top of such models without modifying and re-training them. In this contribution we present a research activity of the Pattern Recognition and Applications Lab of the University of Cagliari related to a recently proposed post hoc uncertainty quantification method, we named dropout injection, which is a variant of the well-known Monte Carlo dropout, and does not require any re-training nor any further gradient descent-based optimization; this makes it a promising, lightweight solution for integrating uncertainty quantification on any already-trained neural network. We are investigating a theoretically grounded solution to make dropout injection as effective as Monte Carlo dropout through a suitable rescaling of its uncertainty measure; we are also evaluating its effectiveness in the computer vision tasks of crowd counting and density estimation for intelligent video surveillance, thanks to our participation in a project funded by the European Space Agency. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Box 447, Arusha, Tanzania","Mduma N., Department of Information and Communication Sciences and Engineering, The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology, P.O. Box 447, Arusha, Tanzania","Predicting student dropout is a challenging problem in the education sector. This is due to an imbalance in student dropout data, mainly because the number of registered students is always higher than the number of dropout students. Developing a model without taking the data imbalance issue into account may lead to an ungeneralized model. In this study, different data balancing techniques were applied to improve prediction accuracy in the minority class while maintaining a satisfactory overall classification performance. Random Over Sampling, Random Under Sampling, Synthetic Minority Over Sampling, SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbor and SMOTE with Tomek links were tested, along with three popular classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Publicly accessible datasets from Tanzania and India were used to evaluate the effectiveness of balancing techniques and prediction models. The results indicate that SMOTE with Edited Nearest Neighbor achieved the best classification performance on the 10-fold holdout sample. Furthermore, Logistic Regression correctly classified the largest number of dropout students (57348 for the Uwezo dataset and 13430 for the India dataset) using the confusion matrix as the evaluation matrix. The applications of these models allow for the precise prediction of at-risk students and the reduction of dropout rates. © 2023 by the author.",classification; data sampling; imbalanced datasets; machine learning; prediction; student dropout,Balancing; Classification (of information); Education computing; Forestry; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Random forests; Students; Balancing techniques; Classification performance; Data sampling; Education sectors; Imbalanced dataset; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Nearest-neighbour; Over sampling; Student dropout; Forecasting,"Lin W.J., Chen J.J., Class-imbalanced classifiers for high-dimensional data, Brief.

Currently, there is a greater capacity to identify patterns and anomalies in an organization’s data using artificial intelligence; The study aimed to develop a classification model for student dropout by applying machine learning with the autoML method of the H2O.ai framework, taking into account the dimensionality of socioeconomic and academic characteristics. The methodology used was predictive and non-experimental, observational and prospective in design; To this end, a 20-item questionnaire was applied to 237 students from the Graduate School enrolled in master’s degree programs in education. The research resulted in a supervised machine learning model, gradient boosting machine, to classify student dropout, thus identifying the main associated factors that influence dropout, obtaining a Gini coefficient of 92.20%, AUC of 96.10% and a LogLoss of 24.24% representing a model with efficient performance. It is concluded that the model is appropriate for its performance metrics, offering advantages such as working with unbalanced data, cross validation and making predictions in real time. © (2024), (Universidad del Zulia).

Various attempts have been made by universities to minimize the number of dropouts. Machine learning has also developed various predictive models to determine the likelihood of students dropping out. However, there is a challenge in dropout data, specifically the problem of class imbalance, where the number of students who drop out (minority class) is significantly less than those who do not drop out (majority class). This imbalance can reduce the model's ability to classify students at risk of dropping out. This study proposes classification optimization using the Random Forest algorithm to handle class imbalances in student dropout data. To overcome class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) techniques are used. Additionally, the attribute selection method is also applied to enhance the predictive results. The test results demonstrate that the combination of implementing feature selection with Chi-Square, followed by class imbalance handling with SMOTE-ENN, provided the most optimal predictive performance for identifying the status of both dropouts and graduates.  © 2023 IEEE.",chi-square; dropout; optimizing; random forest; SMOTE-ENN,Drops; Feature Selection; Random forests; Chi-square; Class imbalance; Drop-out; Dropout; Nearest-neighbour; Optimizing; Random forest classification; Random forests; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Synthetic minority oversampling technique-edited near neighbor; Students,"Gale T., Parker S., The problem with higher education student completions in the global north, International Encyclopedia of Education: Fourth Edition, (2022); Rebai S., Yahia F.B., Essid H., A graphically based machine learning approach to predict secondary schools performance in Tunisia, Socioecon Plann Sci, 70, (2020); Zheng L., Wang C., Chen X., Song Y., Meng Z., Zhang R., Evolutionary machine learning builds smart education big data platform: Data-driven higher education, Appl Soft Comput, 136, (2023); Kruger J.G.C., Britto A., Barddal J.P., An explainable machine learning approach for student dropout prediction, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2022); Orooji M., Chen J., Predicting louisiana public high school dropout through imbalanced learning techniques, Proceedings - 18th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2019, (2019); Stavropoulos G., Van Voorstenbosch R., Van Schooten F.J., Smolinska A., 3.32 - random forest and ensemble methods, Comprehensive Chemometrics: Chemical and Biochemical Data Analysis, Second Edition: Four Volume Set, 3, (2020); Zhang X., Zhou C., Zhu X., Tao Z., Zhao H., Classimbalanced voice pathology classification: Combining hybrid sampling with optimal two-factor random forests, Applied Acoustics, 190, (2022); Hutagaol N., Suharjito, Predictive modelling of student dropout using ensemble classifier method in higher education, Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems, 4, 4, (2019); Bahassine S., Madani A., Al-Sarem M., Kissi M., Feature selection using an improved Chi-square for Arabic text classification, Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences, 32, 2, (2020); Han L., Et al., An explainable XGBoost model improved by SMOTE-ENN technique for maize lodging detection based on multi-source unmanned aerial vehicle images, Comput Electron Agric, 194, (2022); Huang J.C., Et al., Predictive modeling of blood pressure during hemodialysis: A comparison of linear model, random forest, support vector regression, XGBoost, LASSO regression and ensemble method, Comput Methods Programs Biomed, 195, (2020); Sani N.S., Nafuri A.F.M., Othman Z.A., Nazri M.Z.A., Mohamad K.N., Drop-out prediction in higher education among b40 students, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 11, (2020); Onesime M., Yang Z., Dai Q., Genomic island prediction via chi-square test and random forest algorithm, Comput Math Methods Med, 2021, (2021); The Size and Quality of a Data Set.; Imbalanced Data.; Lantz B., Machine Learning with R: Expert techniques for predictive modeling, 4, (2019)","Andri; Universitas Mikroskil, Undergraduate Program of Computer Science Department, Medan, Indonesia; email: andri@mikroskil.ac.id",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183461847,YES,Complies

The significant factors that affect first-year student success are derived and discussed such that they can be used for policy developments by related bodies. The dataset used in experimental analyses includes 11,698 freshman students' data. The problem is constructed as classification models predicting whether a student will be successful or unsuccessful at the end of the first year. A total of 69 input variables are utilized in the models. Naive Bayes, decision tree and random forest algorithms are compared over model prediction performances. Random forest models outperformed others and reached 90.2% accuracy. Findings show that the models including the fall semester CGPA variable performed dramatically better. Moreover, the student's programme name and university placement exam score are identified as the other most significant variables. A critical discussion based on the findings is provided. The developed model may be used as an early warning system, such that necessary actions can be taken after the second week of the spring semester for students predicted to be unsuccessful to increase their success and prevent attrition. © 2024 John Wiley &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0026; Sons Ltd.",classification algorithms; data mining; machine learning; performance evaluation; random forest; student success,,"Aina C., Baici E., Casalone G., Pastore F., The determinants of university dropout: A review of the socio-economic literature, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 79, (2022); Al-Badarenah A., Alsakran J., An automated recommender system for course selection, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7, 3, pp. 166-175, (2016); Al-Barrak M.A., Al-Razgan M., Predicting students final GPA using decision trees: A case study, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 6, 7, pp. 528-533, (2016); Anderton R.S., Evans T., Chivers P.T., Predicting academic success of health science students for first year anatomy and physiology, International Journal of Higher Education, 5, 1, (2016); Beattie G., Laliberte J.W.P., Oreopoulos P., Thrivers and divers: Using non-academic measures to predict college success and failure, Economics of Education Review, 62, pp. 170-182, (2018); Beaulac C., Rosenthal J.S., Predicting university students' academic success and major using random forests, Research in Higher Education, 60, 7, pp. 1048-1064, (2019); Beiter R., Nash R., McCrady M., Rhoades D., Linscomb M., Clarahan M., Sammut S., The prevalence and correlates of depression, anxiety, and stress in a sample of college students, Journal of Affective Disorders, 173, pp. 90-96, (2015); Bowman N.A., Jang N., Kivlighan D.M., Schneider N., Ye X., The impact of a goal-setting intervention for engineering students on academic probation, Research in Higher Education, 61, 1, pp. 142-166, (2020); Buitrago-Florez F., Sanchez M., Perez Romanello V., Hernandez C., Hernandez Hoyos M., A systematic approach for curriculum redesign of introductory courses in engineering: A programming course case study, Kybernetes, 52, pp. 3904-3917, (2022); Cano A., Leonard J.D., Interpretable Multiview early warning system adapted to underrepresented student populations, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 12, 2, pp. 198-211, (2019); Cerdeira J.M., Nunes L.C., Reis A.B., Seabra C., Predictors of student success in higher education: Secondary school internal scores versus national exams, Higher Education Quarterly, 72, 4, pp. 304-313, (2018); Cui G., Leung M.W., Zhang G., Li L., Model selection for direct marketing: Performance criteria and validation methods, Marketing Intelligence &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0026; Planning, 26, 3, pp. 275-292, (2008); Daud A., Aljohani N.R., Abbasi R.A., Lytras M.D., Abbas F., Alowibdi J.S., Predicting student performance using advanced learning analytics.

Our identification strategy relies on quasi-random variation in the proportion of dropouts. The estimated average zero effect of dropouts on first-time students’ success masks treatment heterogeneity and non-linearities. First, we find negative effects on the academic success of their new peers from dropouts who had re-enrolled in the same subject and, conversely, positive effects of dropouts changing subjects. Second, we use causal machine learning methods to find that the effects vary nonlinearly with different treatment intensities and prevailing treatment levels. © 2023 The Author(s)",Better prepared students; Causal machine learning; Peer effects; University dropouts,academic performance; machine learning; student; university sector,"Arcidiacono P., Aucejo E.M., Hotz J., University differences in the graduation of minorities in STEM fields: Evidence from California, American Economic Review, 106, 3, pp. 525-562, (2016); Balestra S., Eugster B., Liebert H., Peers with special needs: Effects and policies, The Review of Economics and Statistics, pp. 1-42, (2020); Balestra S., Sallin A., Wolter S.C., High ability influencers?

In this study, bearing characteristic frequencies (BCFs) extracted from a novel hybrid method combining cepstrum pre-whitening (CPW) and high-pass filtering developed by the authors’ group are used as input features, and a two-stage approach is taken to develop an intelligent REB fault detect and diagnosis model. In the first stage, various machine learning (ML) methods, including support vector machine (SVM), multinomial logistic regressions (MLR), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are evaluated to identify faulty bearings from healthy ones. The best-performing ML model is selected for this stage. In the second stage, a similar evaluation is conducted to find the most suitable ML technique for bearing fault classification. The model is trained and validated using vibration data from an EU Clean Sky2 I2BS project (An EU Clean Sky 2 project ‘Integrated Intelligent Bearing Systems’ collaborated between Schaeffler Technologies and the University of Southampton. Safran Aero Engines was the topic manager for this project) and tested on datasets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the US Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT). The results show that the two-stage model, using an SVM with a polynomial kernel function in Stage-1 and an ANN with one hidden layer and 0.05 dropout rate in Stage-2, can successfully detect bearing conditions in both test datasets and perform better than the results in literature without the requirement of further training. Compared with a single-stage model, the two-stage model also shows improved performance. © 2024 by the authors.",bearing characteristic frequencies; generalised fault diagnosis model; rolling element bearing; SVM and ANN; two-stage intelligent approach; vibration analysis,,"Ambrozkiewicz B., Syta A., Georgiadis A., Gassner A., Litak G., Meier N., Intelligent Diagnostics of Radial Internal Clearance in Ball Bearings with Machine Learning Methods, Sensors, 23, (2023); Yang F., Song M., Ma X., Guo N., Xue Y., Research on H7006C Angular Contact Ball Bearing Slipping Behavior under Operating Conditions, Lubricants, 11, (2023); Wu C., Yang K., Ni J., Lu S., Yao L., Li X., Investigations for Vibration and Friction Torque Behaviors of Thrust Ball Bearing with Self-Driven Textured Guiding Surface, Friction, 11, pp. 894-910, (2023); Toma R.N., Gao Y., Piltan F., Im K., Shon D., Yoon T.H., Yoo D.S., Kim J.M., Classification Framework of the Bearing Faults of an Induction Motor Using Wavelet Scattering Transform-Based Features, Sensors 2022, Vol. 22, Page 8958, 22, (2022); Guo C., Li L., Hu Y., Yan J., A Deep Learning Based Fault Diagnosis Method with Hyperparameter Optimization by Using Parallel Computing, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 131248-131256, (2020); Alshorman O., Irfan M., Saad N., Zhen D., Haider N., Glowacz A., Alshorman A., A Review of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Element Bearings for Induction Motor, Shock Vib, 2020, (2020); Singh V., Gangsar P., Porwal R., Atulkar A., Artificial Intelligence Application in Fault Diagnostics of Rotating Industrial Machines: A State-of-the-Art Review, J.

Analog automation research has been active for several decades, but has not found widespread acceptance due to its general inability to meet the needs of the design community. Therefore, unlike digital design, which has a rich history of automation and extensive deployment of design tools, analog design is largely unautomated. ALIGN attempts to overcome several of the major issues associated with this lack of success. First, to mimic the human designer's ability to recognize sub-blocks and specify constraints, ALIGN has used machine learning (ML) based methods to assist in these tasks. Second, to overcome the limitation of past automation approaches, which are largely specific to a class of designs, ALIGN attempts to create a truly general layout engine by decomposing the layout automation process into a set of steps, with specific constraints that are specific to the family of circuits, which are divided into four classes: low-frequency components (e.g., analog-To-digital converters (ADCs), amplifiers, and filters); wireline components for high-speed links (e.g., equalizers, clock/data recovery circuits, and phase interpolators); RF/Wireless components (e.g., components of RF transmitters and receivers), and power delivery components (e.g., capacitor-and inductor-based DC-DC converters and low dropout (LDO) regulators). For each class of circuits, different sets of constraints are important, depending on their frequency, parasitic sensitivity, need for matching, etc., and ALIGN creates a unified methodological framework that can address each class. Third, in each step, ALIGN has generated new algorithms and approaches to help improve the performance of analog layout. Fourth, given that experienced analog designers desire greater visibility into the process and input into the way that design is carried out, ALIGN is built modularly, providing multiple entry points at which a designer may intervene in the process.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",Analog circuits; Design automation; Layout; Machine learning,Analog to digital conversion; Automation; Computer aided design; DC-DC converters; Electric current regulators; Engines; Machine learning; Open source software; Open systems; Timing circuits; Voltage regulators; Analog layout; Automation research; Design automations; Layout; Machine-learning; Netlist; New approaches; Novel algorithm; Open-source softwares; University industries; Analog circuits,"Kunal K., Et al., ALIGN: Open-source analog layout automation from the ground up, Proc.

Therefore, different strategies are applied to understand this educational phenomenon, although the most outstanding derive from the joint application of statistical approaches and computational techniques based on machine learning. Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is a challenging problem that can be addressed following various strategies. On the one hand, machine learning approaches formulate it as a classification task whose objective is to compute the probability of belonging to a class based on a specific feature vector that will help us to predict who will drop out. Alternatively, survival analysis techniques are applied in a time-varying context to predict when abandonment will occur. This work considered analytical mechanisms for supporting the decision-making process on higher education dropout. We evaluated different computational methods from both approaches for predicting who and when the dropout occurs and sought those with the most-consistent results. Moreover, our research employed a longitudinal dataset including demographic, socioeconomic, and academic information from six academic departments of a Latin American university over thirteen years. Finally, this study carried out an in-depth analysis, discusses how such variables influence estimating the level of risk of dropping out, and questions whether it occurs at the same magnitude or not according to the academic department, gender, socioeconomic group, and other variables. © 2023 by the authors.",machine learning models; student dropout prediction; survival analysis,,"Bernardo A., Esteban M., Fernandez E., Cervero A., Tuero E., Solano P., Comparison of Personal, Social and Academic Variables Related to University Drop-out and Persistence, Front.

We considered only peer-reviewed papers containing 78 empirical and 17 meta-analytic studies. Our theoretical background lies in the different approaches of the terms ‘university dropout’ and ‘academic performance’. After the systematic analysis we ascertained the most commonly used methods are Educational Data Mining (EDM) algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression and neural networks) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The strength of the predictive power depends on the dataset, however Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, Naïve Bayes algorithm were found to be the most precise in prediction. Regarding factors influencing academic performance we derived our results based on 600,000 university students. Considering the data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, reaching up to 900 studies, we found grade point average (GPA), obtained credits (ECTS) and gender to be the most consistent and decisive predictors of academic performance. Nevertheless, GPA and ECTS (as output variables) are mediated by student factors (intrinsic motivation, self-regulated learning strategies, self-efficacy, prior education) and throughput factors (work, finances, academic engagement). We had contradictory results on age and family background. © 2024 The Author(s).

Several machine learning techniques have been used for detecting students at risk of dropout. By using sociodemographic data and qualifications of the previous level, the accuracy of these predictive models is good enough for implementing retention programs. In addition, by using grades of the first semesters, the accuracy of these models increases. Nevertheless, the classification errors produced by these models cause undetected students to be discarded from the retention programs, whereas students with no actual risk consume additional resources. In order to provide more accurate models, we propose the use of a stacking ensemble technique to obtain an improved combined dropout model, while using relatively few variables. The model results show values on the expected ranges for an early dropout model, but with considerably fewer features and historical information, and we show that deploying the models would be cost-efficient for the institution if applied towards an intervention program. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Dropout; Educational Data Mining; Educational Innovation; Higher education,,"Alvarado-Uribe J., Mejia-Almada P., Masetto-Herrera A., Molontay R., Hilliger I., Hegde V., Montemayor-Gallegos J., Ramirez-Diaz R., Ceballos H., Student dataset from Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico to Predict Dropout in Higher Education, Data, (2022); Berens J., Schneider K., Gortz S., Oster S., Burghoff J., Early detection of students at risk - Predicting student dropouts using administrative student data from german universities and machine learning methods, Journal of Educational Data Mining, 11, 3, pp. 1-41, (2019); Borrella I., Caballero-Caballero S., Ponce-Cueto E., Taking action to reduce dropout in MOOCs: tested interventions, Computers & Education, 179, (2022); Casanova J.R., Cervero A., Nunez J.C., Almeida L.S., Bernardo A., Factors that determine the persistence and dropout of university students, Psicothema, 30, 4, pp. 408-414, (2018); Chawla N.V., Bowyer K.W., Hall L.O., Kegelmeyer W.P., SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Chung J.Y., Lee S., Dropout early warning systems for high school students using machine learning, Children and Youth Services Review, 96, pp. 346-353, (2019); Davis J., Goadrich M., The relationship between precision-recall and ROC curves, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 148, pp. 233-240, (2006); Fawcett T., ROC graphs: Notes and practical considerations for researchers, Machine Learning, 31, 1, pp. 1-38, (2004); Gelman A., Hill J., Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models, (2006); Heublein U., Student drop-out from german Higher Education Institutions, European Journal of Education, 49, 4, pp. 497-513, (2013); Isphording I.E., Raabe T., Early Identification of College Dropouts Using Machine-Learning (IZA Research Reports 89), Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), (2019); Kemper L., Vorhoff G., Wigger B.U., Predicting student dropout: a machine learning approach, European Journal of Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 28-47, (2020); Evidence on dropout phenomena at universities (1), Danish Clearinghouse for Educational Research, pp. 1-53, (2013); Latif A., Ai C., Aa H., Economic effects of student dropouts: a comparative study, Journal of Global Economics, 3, 2, pp. 2-5, (2015); Liem J., Dillon C., Gore S., Mental health consequences associated with dropping out of high school, Annual Conference of the American Psychological Association, 109, (2001); Mduma N., Kalegele K., Machuve D., A survey of machine learning approaches and techniques for student dropout prediction, Data Science Journal, 18, 1, (2019); Mubarak A.A., Cao H., Hezam I.M., Deep analytic model for student dropout prediction in massive open online courses, Computers & Electrical Engineering, 93, (2021); Niyogisubizo J., Liao L., Nziyumva E., Murwanashyaka E., Nshimyumukiza P.C., Predicting student’s dropout in university classes using two-layer ensemble machine learning approach: a novel stacked generalization, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Education at a Glance 2022: OECD Indicators, (2022); Ozay M., Vural F.T.Y., A new fuzzy stacked generalization technique and analysis of its performance., (2012); Saito T., Rehmsmeier M., The precision-recall plot is more informative than the ROC plot when evaluating binary classifiers on imbalanced datasets, PLoS One, 10, 3, (2015); Silva J., Roman N., Predicting dropout in Higher Education: A systematic review.

This hesitancy poses a significant obstacle, particularly given the prevalence of educational technology and the abundance of data generated in these environments. In contrast to higher education institutions that readily integrate learning analytics tools into their educational governance, high schools often harbor skepticism regarding the tools’ impact and returns. To overcome these challenges, this work aims to harness learning analytics to address critical areas, such as school dropout rates, the need to foster student collaboration, improving argumentation and writing skills, and the need to enhance computational thinking across all age groups. The goal is to empower teachers and decision makers with learning analytics tools that will equip them to identify learners in vulnerable or exceptional situations, enabling educational authorities to take suitable actions that are aligned with students’ needs; this could potentially involve adapting learning processes and organizational structures to meet the needs of students. This work also seeks to evaluate the impact of such analytics tools on education within a multi-dimensional and scalable domain, ranging from individual learners to teachers and principals, and extending to broader governing bodies. The primary objective is articulated through the development of a user-friendly AI-based dashboard for learning. This prototype aims to provide robust support for teachers and principals who are dedicated to enhancing the education they provide within the intricate and multifaceted social domain of the school. © 2024 by the authors.",adaptive learning; artificial intelligence; dashboard; education; learning analytics; machine learning,adaptive management; artificial intelligence; governance approach; higher education; learning; machine learning; student,"Hooda M., Rana C., Dahiya O., Rizwan A., Hossain M.S., Artificial Intelligence for Assessment and Feedback to Enhance Student Success in Higher Education, Math.

However, in the crises that Lebanon is going through, it is becoming a serious financial problem for Lebanese private universities. To try to minimize it, it must be predicted in order to implement the appropriate actions. In this paper, a method to build the appropriate prediction system is presented. First, it generates a data source of predictor variables from student dataset collected from a faculty of economic sciences in Beirut between 2010 and 2020. Then, it will build a prediction model using data classification techniques based on identified predictor variables and validate it. Using open-source software and free cloud environments, a prediction program was developed. It consolidates, corrects, and normalizes the student's data. Then, it applies simple linear regression to show the correlation between the different variables and the student dropout, which allows us to select the factors that are highly correlated. From this point on, the program tries to predict the student dropout using different classification algorithms by machine learning on student dataset who left their courses either in success or in failure. Lastly, it measures the accuracy of the results and determines the best algorithm.

This change in the classroom and workplace setting is characterized by changing skill requirements, accelerating knowledge obsolescence, need for personalized and adaptive learning experiences, a culture of continuous learning, and on-demand performance support. The educational landscape is changing with the intervention of technology into our lives and new and innovative ways of learning are emerging. The key stakeholders in the education system are teachers and their professional development has utmost significance in helping education pick pace with societal changes. The various strategies of microlearning are useful for teachers to enhance their skills and mitigate the impact fourth industrial revolution is having in terms of quicker knowledge obsolescence and new job creation. Microlearning can provide considerable benefits in the Indian classroom context since traditional educational systems struggle to keep up with these changes. According to a Deloitte University Press research report, microlearning can improve learning retention rates because it provides learners with bite-sized, focused content that is easier to digest and retain than lengthy classroom lectures or training sessions. The interactive and self-directed learning approaches, such as microlearning, can lead to higher learning outcomes compared to traditional classroom teaching (Sitzmann, 2011). The paper provides a look into effective microlearning strategies that can help in dealing with the problems of the traditional classrooms in the current digital society. © Italian e-Learning Association.",Continuous Learning; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Microlearning; Professional Development,,"Ajani O.

The methodology used was of a technological type, purposeful level, incremental innovation, temporal scope, and synchronous; data collection was prospective. For this, a 20-item questionnaire was applied to 237 students enrolled in the master's degree programs in the education of the Graduate School. The research resulted in a supervised machine learning model, Gradient Reinforcement Machine (GBM), to classify student dropout, thus identifying the main associated factors that influence dropout, obtaining a Gini coefficient of 92.20%, AUC of 96.10% and a LogLoss of 24.24% representing a model with efficient performance.

This makes it difficult for English teachers to improve college English translation by using unique materials, so as to form their own unique teaching style. In view of this, a multimedia comprehensive English translation framework based on the combination of big data technology and multimedia teaching mode is proposed. At the same time, the idea of building the framework is introduced from two perspectives: the integration of big data technology and multimedia, and the integration of multimedia and English teaching process. Then, a recursive neural network algorithm based on ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed and tested.

In addition, the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) is characterized by an overabundance of parameters and a substantial requirement for training samples. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel fault diagnosis algorithm for rolling bearings, integrating a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) with a support vector machine (SVM) to form an enhanced 1DCNN-SVM model. This model is further refined using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) for the optimal adjustment of the parameters of 1DCNN-SVM. Specifically, by substituting the CNN’s final softmax layer with an SVM, the model becomes better suited for processing limited data volumes. In addition, the incorporation of batch normalization and dropout layers within the CNN framework significantly augments its fault classification accuracy for rolling bearings, concurrently mitigating the risk of overfitting. The SSA is subsequently applied to refine three principal hyper-parameters: batch size, initial learning rate, and the L2 regularization coefficient, thereby overcoming the challenges associated with manually adjusting parameters, such as extended processing times and unpredictable outcomes. Empirical tests on Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets revealed the model’s superior performance, with the SSA-optimized 1DCNN-SVM showcasing diagnostic accuracies over 98%, marked improvements over conventional models, and a significant reduction in processing times. This method not only marks a significant advancement in intelligent fault diagnosis for rolling bearings but also demonstrates the potential of integrating machine learning for more precise and efficient diagnostics. The SSA-1DCNN-SVM model, optimized for accuracy and minimal data use, sets a new standard in fault diagnosis, relevant for machinery health monitoring and maintenance strategies across various industries. © 2024 Author(s).",,Batch data processing; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Fault detection; Learning algorithms; Roller bearings; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Processing time; Rolling bearings; Search Algorithms; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Traditional approaches; algorithm; article; convolutional neural network; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; feature extraction; machine learning; nonhuman; sparrow; support vector machine; Failure analysis,"Das O., Das D.B., Birant D., Machine learning for fault analysis in rotating machinery: A comprehensive review, Heliyon, 9, (2023); Wu G., Yan T., Yang G., Chai H., Cao C., A review on rolling bearing fault signal detection methods based on different sensors, Sensors, 22, (2022); Hakim M., Omran A.A.B., Ahmed A.N., Al-Waily M., Abdellatif A., A systematic review of rolling bearing fault diagnoses based on deep learning and transfer learning: Taxonomy, overview, application, open challenges, weaknesses and recommendations, Ain Shams Eng.

With an emphasis on women's attrition trends, this research investigates the topic of private education institutions. Specifically, gender-specific dynamics in the workplace are emphasised in the first portion of the research, which examines the factors that cause women to leave these institutions. This is followed by the development of a comprehensive evaluation system that combines statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and historical data to estimate and understand the attrition patterns. Based on the investigation's findings, female employee turnover at private education institutes may be significantly predicted by a variety of criteria, including work-life balance, opportunities for professional progress, and workplace culture. Sophisticated statistical models, including logistic regression and decision tree analysis, are used in the study to estimate attrition trends and show these variables' relative relevance. Through the implementation of HR analytics, organisations may enhance their ability to predict these concerns, formulate policies that consider gender parity, and foster a fairer and more supportive workplace culture. Apart from emphasising the importance of data-driven decision-making in retaining talent, this study provides HR professionals and organisational leaders with a valuable framework to enhance employee contentment and reduce attrition rates among female students enrolled in private Universities.  © 2023 IEEE.",attrition pattern; career advancement; gender-specific dynamics; HR analytics; predictive modeling; private education colleges; women; work-life balance,Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Personnel; Predictive analytics; Attrition pattern; Career advancement; Employee turnover; Gender-specific dynamic; Human resource analytics; Predictive models; Private education college; Private educations; Woman; Work-life balance; Decision trees,"Roux A., Et al., Study protocol comparing the ethical, psychological and socio-economic impact of personalised breast cancer screening to that of standard screening in the My Personal Breast Screening (MyPeBS) randomised clinical trial, BMC cancer, 22, 1, pp. 1-13, (2022); Del C Triana M., Gu P., Chapa O., Richard O., Colella A., Sixty years of discrimination and diversity research in human resource management: A review with suggestions for future research directions, Human Resource Management, 60, 1, pp. 145-204, (2021); Das S., Kotikula A., Gender-based employment segregation: Understanding causes and policy interventions, (2019); Joseph M.M., Ahasic A.M., Clark J., Templeton K., State of women in medicine: History, challenges, and the benefits of a diverse workforce, Pediatrics, 148, (2021); Xu Y., Et al., Exploring patient medication adherence and data mining methods in clinical big data: A contemporary review, Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine, (2023); Friedman D.B., Et al., Value of peer mentorship for equity in higher education leadership: A school of public health focus with implications for all academic administrators, Mentoring & Tutoring: Partnership in Learning, 29, 5, pp. 500-521, (2021); Poole A.H., Agosto D., Greenberg J., Lin X., Yan E., Where do we stand?

In this study, we developed models to predict student attrition for the Chartered Accountancy programme at the University of Namibia (UNAM). Three hundred and eighty-nine records of accounting students were collected from the UNAM student database. We applied five classification machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision trees (DT) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to identify patterns in student attrition. After, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F-measure and Area Under Curve were computed to measure the performance of each model. Finally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was used to determine how variables influenced model prediction. The LR, k-NN, DT, SVM and GNB achieved an accuracy of 80.3%, 73.8%, 82%, 80.3% and 77%, respectively. Overall, the DT classifier performed the best at predicting student attrition. We found that academic performance in year 1 core modules: financial accounting A and financial accounting B were the most important features, on average contributing the most to the predicted probability of dropping out. We have demonstrated that it is feasible to predict students who are likely to abandon their studies while in their first year. The major difference between our study and previous studies is that we do not focus on traditional studied areas (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). In this study, we developed predictive models to identify student attrition in the bachelor of accounting program in a Namibian university. © 2023 IEEE.",accounting students; machine learning; prediction; retention; student attrition,Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Students; Support vector regression; Accounting student; Case-studies; Financial accounting; Gaussians; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Naive bayes; Namibia; Retention; Student attrition; Forecasting,"Baranyi M., Nagy M., Molontay R., Interpretable deep learning for university dropout prediction, Proceedings of the 21st annual conference on information technology education, pp. 13-19, (2020); Delen D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management, Decision support Systems, 49, 4, pp. 498-506, (2010); Fahd K., Venkatraman S., Miah S.J., Ahmed K., Application of machine learning in higher education to assess student academic performance, at-risk, and attrition: A meta-analysis of literature, Education and Information Technologies, pp. 1-33, (2021); Strategic plan 2019-2024, (2019); Nakale S., Shinkeva L., MacHaya E., Bachelor of accounting: Chartered Accountancy programme student performance analysis; Palacios C.A., Reyes-Suarez J., Bearzotti L.A., Leiva V., Marchant C., Knowledge discovery for higher education student retention based on data mining: Machine learning algorithms and case study in Chile, Entropy, 23, 4, pp. 1-23, (2021); Bedregal-Alpaca N., Cornejo-Aparicio V., Zarate-Valderrama J., Yanque-Churo P., Classification models for determining types of academic risk and predicting dropout in university students, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 1, pp. 266-272, (2020); Viloria A., Padilla J.G., Vargas-Mercado C., Hernandez-Palma H., Llinas N.O., David M.A., Integration of data technology for analyzing university dropout, Procedia Computer Science, 155, pp. 569-574, (2019); Barramuno M., Meza-Narvaez C., Galvez-Garcia G., Prediction of student attrition risk using machine learning, Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 14, 3, pp. 974-986, (2022); Lundberg S.M., Lee S.-I., A unified approach to interpreting model predictions, Proceedings of the 31st international conference on neural information processing systems, pp. 4768-4777, (2017)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176750110,,

Design/methodology/approach: The real-world samples comprised the enrolled records of 2,412 first-year students of a private university (UNI) in Taiwan. This work utilized decision trees (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and logistic regression (LR) algorithms for constructing EPMs; under-sampling, random oversampling and synthetic minority over sampling technique (SMOTE) methods for solving data imbalance problems; accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) for evaluating constructed EPMs. Findings: DT outperformed MLP and LR with accuracy (97.59%), precision (98%), recall (97%), F1_score (97%), and ROC-AUC (98%). The top-ranking factors comprised “student loan,” “dad occupations,” “mom educational level,” “department,” “mom occupations,” “admission type,” “school fee waiver” and “main sources of living.” Practical implications: This work only used enrollment information to identify dropout students and crucial factors associated with dropout probability as soon as students enter universities. The extracted rules could be utilized to enhance student retention. Originality/value: Although first-year student dropouts have gained non-stop attention from researchers in educational practices and theories worldwide, diverse previous studies utilized while-and/or post-semester factors, and/or questionnaires for predicting. These methods failed to offer universities early warning systems (EWS) and/or assist them in providing in-time assistance to dropouts, who face economic difficulties. This work provided universities with an EWS and extracted rules for early dropout prevention and intervention. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crucial factors for student dropouts; Early prediction models;

Fol-lowing systematic procedures, our team created a conceptual framework through an extant literature review and used it to create an initial pool of 48 items across eight educational application domains of AI (Ahmad et al., 2020). We conducted think aloud protocols with a small group (N = 4) of undergraduate students and an expert review with researchers experienced in AI, psychometrics, and education (N = 3) to en-sure the intended meaning of the language was aligned with our framework. Next, we recruited undergraduate student participants (N = 445) from two public universities and one state college in the southeastern United States to complete the final survey. Data were randomly split into two datasets, one for fitting a Confirmatory Factor Analysis model, and the other one for testing the model. The final model retained 37 items across the eight factors of conceptions of AI in education: (AI1) intelligent tutoring system, (AI2) students’ grading and evaluation, (AI3) students’ retention and dropout, (AI4) sentiment analysis in education, (AI5) recommendation systems, (AI6) classroom monitoring and visual analysis, (AI7) personalized learning, and (AI8) student performance prediction.

We created an AI-based chatbot that gathered both qualitative and quantitative data from nearly 1200 participants worldwide. The entire human-AI interaction process was managed autonomously by the AI without researcher intervention. We analysed all data collected by the AI and identified relevant matriculation decision factors and themes. The AI collaboration demonstrated remarkable efficacy in streamlining the research workflow by consistently adhering to predefined criteria, eliminating variations and human-induced biases, establishing rapport with participants, and amplifying not just the efficiency and scalability of data collection but also the reliability and generalizability of the research findings. Acquiring such insights into students’ university choice factors from such a diversified and large sample may potentially empower policymakers to make informed decisions that synch higher education policies with students’ preferences, expectations, and needs, ultimately aiding institutions to improve recruitment and retention strategies leading to better overall performance and outcomes for both students and the institution itself. From an economic perspective, gaining this insight can foster closer alignment between higher education and the job market. By understanding students’ aspirations and the influences driving their decisions, institutions can tailor programmes that not only enhance graduates’ job prospects but also proactively contribute to economic growth and the development of a highly skilled and committed workforce. © 2024 Society for Research into Higher Education.",AI-based chatbot; Artificial intelligence; higher education; matriculation decisions; university choice,,"Amiri P., Karahanna E., Chatbot Use Cases in the Covid-19 Public Health Response, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 29, 5, pp. 1000-1010, (2022); Androutsopoulou A., Karacapilidis N., Loukis E., Charalabidis Y., Transforming the Communication between Citizens and Government through AI-Guided Chatbots, Government Information Quarterly, 36, 2, pp. 358-367, (2019); Bergerson A.A., College Choice and Access to College: Moving Policy, Research, and Practice to the 21st Century, ASHE Higher Education Report, 35, 4, pp. 1-141, (2009); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical Questions for Big Data Information, Communication & Society, 15, 5, pp. 662-679, (2012); Briggs S., Wilson A., Which University?

Big data benefits business by providing enhanced decision making, offering novel perceptions, and incorporating competent processing. Big data and Industry 4.0 are also used to enhance the learner’s involvement and experience and utilization of Tutor time. University leaders are keen in using technologies to check if students get detached and are at risk. Big data helps Universities to determine the institute’s retention, progress and completion aspects relating to students. This further assists in lowering attrition by the early discovery of at-risk learners and informing teachers and administrators. This paper attempts to provide an insight of the research and steps taken by various universities or education bodies towards pooling this varied data both structured and unstructured that is present in a massive amount and can be exploited for prediction related to student’s progress and status.

As universities struggle to support students' engagement, success and retention, learning analytics is being used to build predictive models and develop dashboards to support learners and help them stay engaged, to help teachers identify students needing support, and to predict and prevent dropout. Learning with Big Data has its challenges, however: managing great quantities of data requires time and expertise. To predict students at risk, many institutions use machine learning algorithms with LMS data for a given course or type of course, but only a few are trying to make predictions for a large subset of courses. This begs the question: ""How can student dropout be predicted on a very large set of courses in an institution Moodle LMS?""In this paper, we use automation to improve student dropout prediction for a very large subset of courses, by clustering them based on course design and similarity, then by automatically training, testing, and selecting machine learning algorithms for each cluster. We developed a promising methodology that outlines a basic framework that can be adjusted and optimized in many ways and that further studies can easily build on and improve.  © 2023 ACM.",dropout prediction; engagement; learning analytics; Moodle LMS,Clustering algorithms; Curricula; Education computing; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Teaching; Cluster-based; Dropout prediction; Engagement; High educations; Large-scale modeling; Learning analytic; Learning management system; Machine learning algorithms; Moodle LMS; Performance; Students,"Arnold K.E., Pistilli M.D., Course signals at Purdue: Using learning analytics to increase student success, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 267-270, (2012); Berland M., Baker R.S., Blikstein P., 2014 Educational data mining and learning analytics: Applications to constructionist research, Technology, Knowledge and Learning, 19, 1, pp. 205-220, (2014); Calinski T., Harabasz J., 1974 A dendrite method for cluster analysis, Communications in Statistics-Theory and Methods, 3, 1, pp. 1-27, (1974); Desmarais M., Lemieux F., Clustering and visualizing study state sequences, Educational Data Mining, 2013, (2013); Du X., Yang J., Shelton B.E., Hung J., Zhang M., 2021 A systematic meta-review and analysis of learning analytics research, Behaviour & Information Technology 40, 1, 2021, pp. 49-62; Fredricks J.A., Blumenfeld P.C., Paris A.H., 2004 School Engagement: Potential of the Concept, State of the Evidence.

Objective: In the present study, a prediction model combining Survival Analysis, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, under the Machine Learning philosophy, is proposed for the early diagnosis of possible factors causing dropout in university students. Methods: The proposal consists of 3 phases: the Survival Analysis that allows estimating the probability of permanence of the student (survival). Phase 2 starts from the probability value obtained in the previous phase and uses it as a response variable in the modeling process based on Decision Trees to establish survival patterns around the variables considered. Finally, in phase 3, the critical variables in the model are identified using the Random Forest. Results: The proposed methodology allowed the design of a prediction model to identify the main segmentation variables in behavior patterns of possible cases of academic dropout. Conclusion: Even though the proposal was developed considering a particular case of a Chilean university, the efficient combination of metaheuristics allows the extrapolation of the methodology to any context and academic reality. However, the conditions and needs of each institution must be considered. © 2024, Polytechnic Institute of Viseu.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the body of literature devoted to this topic, however, much of this literature is aimed at analyzing the impact of dual enrollment courses on performance in community colleges. This study will examine the relationship between high school students taking dual enrollment courses and their later performance at a public, R1 university. Additionally, this study will employ Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a type of supervised statistical learning for identifying the success factors for dually enrolled students based on academic, demographic, and socio-economic features.

Therefore, there is significant incentive for studies that use data to support decisions by predicting risk of dropout so that institutions can attempt to prevent such cases. Although machine learning techniques were shown to have potential for this task, there are many steps involved when it comes to the use of real data, which comes from scattered systems and present issues such as need for data cleaning and preparation, high dimensionality of the data requiring adequate feature selection, as well as class imbalance. In this paper, we used data from 32.892 students enrolled between 2008 and 2020 from all courses offered by a public high-education institution. A protocol for data preparation is proposed and found to be more important than designing complex classifiers. We present guidelines when modelling a college dropout classification task using a public university data and experiments using Walk-Forward Validation that showed the predictive capacity for the first years. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",College Dropout; Higher Education; Machine Learning,Classification (of information); Learning systems; Students; College dropout; College students; Data preparation; Educational institutions; Educational management; High educations; Machine-learning; Risk predictions; Social problems; Walk forward; Machine learning,"Abu-Oda G.S., El-Halees A.M., Data mining in higher education: University student dropout case study, Int.

Identifying at-risk students early and knowing the factors that contribute to their success would be useful for designing educational interventions. Educational Data Mining (EDM) methods can identify students at risk of poor academic progress and dropping out. The main goal of this study was to use machine learning models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Naïve Bayes (NB), to identify first year medical students that succeed academically, using sociodemographic data and academic history. Methods: Data from seven cohorts (2011 to 2017) of admitted medical students to the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Faculty of Medicine in Mexico City were analysed. Data from 7,976 students (2011 to 2017 cohorts) of the program were included. Information from admission diagnostic exam results, academic history, sociodemographic characteristics and family environment was used. The main dataset included 48 variables. The study followed the general knowledge discovery process: pre-processing, data analysis, and validation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Naïve Bayes (NB) models were used for data mining analysis. Results: ANNs models had slightly better performance in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Both models had better sensitivity when classifying regular students and better specificity when classifying irregular students. Of the 25 variables with highest predictive value in the Naïve Bayes model, percentage of correct answers in the diagnostic exam was the best variable. Conclusions: Both ANN and Naïve Bayes methods can be useful for predicting medical students’ academic achievement in an undergraduate program, based on information of their prior knowledge and socio-demographic factors. Although ANN offered slightly superior results, Naïve Bayes made it possible to obtain an in-depth analysis of how the different variables influenced the model. The use of educational data mining techniques and machine learning classification techniques have potential in medical education. © 2024, The Author(s).",Artificial neural networks; Educational data mining; Medical education; Naïve Bayes; Prediction; Student academic progress,"Achievement; Bayes Theorem; Educational Status; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Students, Medical; academic achievement; article; artificial neural network; data mining; female; human; knowledge discovery; machine learning; male; medical education; medical student; Mexico; Mexico City; prediction; predictive value; sensitivity and specificity; sociodemographics; achievement; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; educational status","Silva L.M., La importancia del primer año universitario: de la teoría a la práctica, (2015); Picton A., Greenfield S., Parry J., Why do students struggle in their first year of medical school?

Most implemented machine learning frameworks for predicating university student drop-out have data validation points limitations which are not hyper-tuned from datasets used thereby not providing accurate predication of likelihood for student dropouts. Therefore, this research developed a convolutional neural network framework that predicts student attrition in relation to influential factors. The study employed a rigorous methodology to collect and preprocess data from a diverse set of universities, which was then used to train and test the CNN model. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to ensure its robustness and effectiveness in predicting student dropouts. The findings of this study can serve as a valuable resource for future research in this area.  © 2023 IEEE.",Framework; Machine learning; Neural Networks; Prediction,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Drops; Machine learning; Students; Convolutional neural network; Data validation; Drop-out; Framework; Influential factors; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Network frameworks; Neural-networks; University students; Forecasting,"Pan F., Et al., A survival analysis based volatility and sparsity modeling network for student dropout prediction, PLoS One, 17, pp. 1-22, (2022); Staiculescu C., Elena Ramona R.N., University dropout.

Using the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, various models, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Ensemble Model, were employed to predict student performance in three categories: Pass/Fail, Close to Fail, and Close to Pass. The Ensemble Model (EM) consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest overall F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. These results highlight the potential of data-driven techniques in informing educational stakeholders’ decision-making processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating personalized learning strategies tailored to students’ needs. By identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications, including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic excellence. Future research aims to investigate the impact of individual activities on student performance and explore day-to-day student behaviors, enabling the creation of tailored pedagogical policies and guidelines. © The Author(s) 2023.",academic performance; decision trees; ensemble methods support vector machines; machine learning; neural networks,,"Agrawal H., Mavani H., Student performance prediction using machine learning, International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology, 4, 3, pp. 111-113, (2015); Ahmad I., Basheri M., Iqbal M.J., Et al., Performance comparison of support vector machine, random forest, and extreme learning machine for intrusion detection, IEEE access, 6, pp. 33789-33795, (2018); Al-Shehri H., Al-Qarni A., Al-Saati L., Et al., pp. 1-4; Albreiki B., Zaki N., Alashwal H., A systematic literature review of student’performance prediction using machine learning techniques, Education Sciences, 11, 9, (2021); Alhadabi A., Karpinski A.C., Grit, self-efficacy, achievement orientation goals, and academic performance in university students, International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 25, 1, pp. 519-535, (2020); Alyahyan E., Dustegor D., Predicting academic success in higher education: Literature review and best practices, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, pp. 1-21, (2020); Andres H., The role of active teaching, academic self-efficacy, and learning behaviors in student performance, Journal of International Education in Business, 13, 2, pp. 221-238, (2020); Avdic A., Gronberg P., Olsson J., Et al., Development of a real-time formative feedback student response system, Journal of Network and Innovative Computing, 2, (2014); Biggs J., Collis K., Towards a model of school-based curriculum development and assessment using the SOLO taxonomy, Australian Journal of Education, 33, 2, pp. 151-163, (1989); Bolkan S., Goodboy A.K., Behavioral indicators of transformational leadership in the college classroom, Qualitative Research Reports in Communication, 12, 1, pp. 10-18, (2011); Canning N., Callan S., Heutagogy: Spirals of reflection to empower learners in higher education, Reflective Practice, 11, 1, pp. 71-82, (2010); Chamorro-Premuzic T., Furnham A., Personality, intelligence and approaches to learning as predictors of academic performance, Personality And Individual Differences, 44, 7, pp. 1596-1603, (2008); Chen J., Zhang Y., Wei Y., Et al., Discrimination of the contextual features of top performers in scientific literacy using a machine learning approach, Research in Science Education, 51, pp. 129-158, (2021); Collis K.F., Biggs J.B., (1979); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Cortez P., Silva A.M.G., pp. 5-12, (2008); Dabhade P., Agarwal R., Alameen K.P., Et al., Educational data mining for predicting students’ academic performance using machine learning algorithms, Materials Today: Proceedings, 47, pp. 5260-5267, (2021); Destin M., Hanselman P., Buontempo J., Et al., Do student mindsets differ by socioeconomic status and explain disparities in academic achievement in the United States?, AERA open, 5, 3, (2019); Dietterich T.G., Ensemble methods in machine learning, International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, (2000); Evans J.M., Brown A., Baker G.R., Organizational knowledge and capabilities in healthcare: Deconstructing and integrating diverse perspectives, SAGE Open Medicine, 5, (2017); Gikandi J.W., Morrow D., Davis N.E., Online formative assessment in higher education: A review of the literature, Computers & Education, 57, 4, pp. 2333-2351, (2011); Goldberg P., Sumer O., Sturmer K., Et al., Attentive or not?

This study seeks to identify its specific causes. An initial database of 143,326 student records was used to which data cleaning and preparation processes were applied to apply machine learning techniques. The original table showed 8.1% dropout, with information on 35 categorical and 14 numerical variables. The analysis of the categorical variables made it possible to identify segments with a greater tendency to drop out, supporting specific interventions. Through principal component analysis and clustering, profiles of students prone to dropout were identified, the results of which support our previous work where we used Random Forest as the most appropriate classifier to predict dropout. The combination of these findings will make it possible to formulate recommendations for more effective interventions, supporting universities in reducing student dropout and improving academic success. © 2023 IEEE.",Educational innovation; Higher education; Machine learning; Predictive models; Student dropout,Education computing; Forestry; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Random forests; Categorical variables; Data cleaning; Data preparation; Educational innovations; Educational settings; High educations; Machine-learning; Numerical variables; Predictive models; Student dropout; Students,"Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting student dropout in higher education, (2016); Heublein U., Student Dropout from German Higher Education Institutions, European Journal of Education, 49, 4, pp. 497-513, (2014); Hsu C.W., Yeh C.C., Mining the student dropout in higher education, Journal of Testing and Evaluation, 48, 6, pp. 4563-4575, (2019); Olaya D., Vasquez J., Maldonado S., Miranda J., Verbeke W., Uplift Modeling for preventing student dropout in higher education, Decision Support Systems, 134, (2020); Alvarado-Uribe J., Mejia-Almada P., Masetto H.A.L., Molontay R., Hilliger I., Hedge V., Montemayor G.J.E., Ramirez D.R.A., Ceballos H.G., Student Dataset from Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico to Predict Dropout in Higher Education, Data, 7, 9, (2022); Garg A., Lilhore U., Ghosh P., Et al., Machine Learning-based Model for Prediction of Student's Performance in Higher Education, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks, SPIN 2021, pp. 162-168, (2021); Cameron S.V., Heckman J.J., The dynamics of educational attainment for black, Hispanic, and white males, Journal of Political Economy, 109, pp. 455-499, (2001); Wexler J., Pyle N., Dropout prevention and the model-minority stereotype: Reflections from an Asian American high school dropout, The Urban Review, 44, 5, pp. 551-570, (2012); Balfanz R., Herzog L., Mac I.D.J., Preventing student disengagement and keeping students on the graduation path in urban middle-grades schools: Early identification and effective interventions, Educational Psychologist, 42, 4, pp. 223-235, (2007); Amare M.Y., Simonova S., Global challenges of students' dropout: A prediction model development using machine learning algorithms on higher education datasets, SHS Web of Conferences, 129, (2021); Saravanan T., Nagadeepa N., Mukunthan B., The Effective Learning Approach to ICT-TPACK and Prediction of the Academic Performance of Students Based on Machine Learning Techniques, (2022); Dynarski M., Clarke L., Cobb B., Finn J., Rumberger R., Smink J., Dropout prevention: A practice guide (NCEE 2008-4025), (2008); Gonzalez-Nucamendi A., Noguez J., Neri L., Robledo-Rella V., Garcia-Castelan R.M.G., Predictive Models for Early Detection of Engineering Students at Risk of a Course Failure, 2022.

At the course level, the combination of predictive analytics and self-regulation theory can help instructors determine the best study advice and allow learners to better self-regulate and determine how they want to learn. The best performing techniques are often black-box models that favor performance over interpretability and are heavily influenced by course contexts. In this study, we argue that explainable AI has the potential not only to uncover the reasons behind model decisions, but also to reveal their stability across contexts, effectively bridging the gap between predictive and explanatory learning analytics (LA). In contributing to decision support systems research, this study (1) leverages traditional techniques, such as concept drift and performance drift, to investigate the stability of student success prediction models over time; (2) uses Shapley Additive explanations in a novel way to explore the stability of extracted feature importance rankings generated for these models; (3) generates new insights that emerge from stable features across cohorts, enabling teachers to determine study advice. We believe this study makes a strong contribution to education research at large and expands the field of LA by augmenting the interpretability and explainability of prediction algorithms and ensuring their applicability in changing contexts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Explainable AI; Learning analytics; Model stability; Self-regulated learning,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Education computing; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Students; Decision supports; Explainable AI; High educations; Interpretability; Learning analytic; Model stability; Prediction modelling; Self-regulated learning; Student learning process; Student success; Stability,"Coussement K., Phan M., De Caigny A., Benoit D.F., Raes A., Predicting student dropout in subscription-based online learning environments: The beneficial impact of the logit leaf model, Decis.

However, there is scarce literature analyzing these attributes across health professions education. The current study aims to explore rates of student retention, progression, and graduation across five colleges of the Health Cluster at Qatar University, and identify predictive factors. Methods: Secondary longitudinal data for students enrolled at the Health Cluster between 2015 and 2021 were subject to descriptive statistics to obtain retention, progression and graduation rates. The importance of student demographic and academic variables in predicting retention, progression, or graduation was determined by a predictive model using XGBoost, after preparation and feature engineering. A predictive model was constructed, in which weak decision tree models were combined to capture the relationships between the initial predictors and student outcomes. A feature importance score for each predictor was estimated; features that had higher scores were indicative of higher influence on student retention, progression, or graduation. Results: A total of 88% of the studied cohorts were female Qatari students. The rates of retention and progression across the studied period showed variable distribution, and the majority of students graduated from health colleges within a timeframe of 4–7 years. The first academic year performance, followed by high school GPA, were factors that respectively ranked first and second in importance in predicting retention, progression, and graduation of health majors students. The health college ranked third in importance affecting retention and graduation and fifth regarding progression. The remaining factors including nationality, gender, and whether students were enrolled in a common first year experience for all colleges, had lower predictive importance. Conclusions: Student retention, progression, and graduation at Qatar University Health Cluster is complex and multifactorial. First year performance and secondary education before college are important in predicting progress in health majors after the first year of university study. Efforts to increase retention, progression, and graduation rates should include academic advising, student support, engagement and communication. Machine learning-based predictive algorithms remain a useful tool that can be precisely leveraged to identify key variables affecting health professions students’ performance. © 2023, The Author(s).",Health education; Machine learning; Student graduation; Student progression; Student retention; XGBoost,"Health Occupations; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Qatar; Schools; Students, Health Occupations; academic success; adult; algorithm; article; decision tree; diagnosis; female; health education; high school; human; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical profession; nationality; predictive model; Qatar; Qatari; secondary education; student; student retention; health student; medical profession; Qatar; school","Kinzie J., Kuh G., Reframing student success in college: advancing know-what and know-how, Change, 49, 3, pp. 19-27, (2017); Tinto V., Leaving College: Rethinking the Causes and Cures of Student Attrition, (2012); Hovdhaugen E., Frolich N., Aamodt P.O., Informing Institutional Management: institutional strategies and student retention, Eur J Educ, 48, 1, pp. 165-177, (2013); Burke A., Student retention models in higher education: a literature review, Coll Univ, 94, 2, pp. 12-21, (2019); Cotton D.R., Nash T., Kneale P., Supporting the retention of non-traditional students in Higher Education using a resilience framework, Eur Educ Res J, 16, 1, pp. 62-79, (2017); Muller K., Feuer E., Nyman M., Sokolowski K., Rotella L., Examining predictors of first year college student retention, N Y J Stud Aff, 17, 1, (2017); Gansemer-Topf A.M., Downey J., Thompson K., Genschel U., Did the recession impact student success?

Whereas invaluable insights and theories for measuring and testing the topic have been proposed, most of the existing methods do not technically highlight the non-trivial factors behind the renowned challenges and attrition. To this effect, by making use of two categories of data collected in a higher education setting about students (i) retention (n = 52262) and (ii) graduation (n = 53639); this study proposes a machine learning model - RG-DMML (retention and graduation data mining and machine learning) and ensemble algorithm for prediction of students' retention and graduation status in education. This was done by training and testing key features that are technically deemed suitable for measuring the constructs (retention and graduation), such as (i) the Average grade of the previous high school, and (ii) the Entry/admission score. The proposed model (RG-DMML) is designed based on the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, implemented using supervised machine learning technique such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and validated using the k-fold cross-validation method. The results show that the executed model and algorithm based on the Bagging method and 10-fold cross-validation are efficient and effective for predicting the student's retention and graduation status, with Precision (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.822), Recall (retention = 1.000, graduation = 0.957), Accuracy (retention = 0.909, graduation = 0.817), F1-Score (retention = 0.952, graduation = 0.885) showing significant high accuracy levels or performance rate, and low Error-rate (retention = 0.090, graduation = 0.182), respectively. In addition, by considering the individual features selected through the Wrapper method in predicting the outputs, the proposed model proved more effective for predicting the students' retention status in comparison to the graduation data. The implications of the models' output and factors that impact the effective prediction or identification of at-risk students, e.g., for timely intervention, counselling, decision-making, and sustainable educational practice are empirically discussed in the study. © 2024",AI in education;

Approximately 40 percent of students seeking a bachelor’s degree do not graduate within 6 years; among nontraditional students, who make up half of the undergraduate population, dropout rates are even higher. In this study, we developed a machine learning classifier using the XGBoost model and data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study: 2012/14 to predict nontraditional student dropout. In comparison with baseline models, the XGBoost model and logistic regression model with features identified by the XGBoost model displayed superior performance in predicting dropout. The predictive ability of the model and the features it identified as being most important in predicting nontraditional student dropout can inform discussion among educators seeking ways to identify and support at-risk students early in their postsecondary careers. © The Author(s) 2020.",decision trees; dropout rates; machine learning; nontraditional students,,"Aguiar E., (2015).

Since a high dropout rate for university students is a significant risk to local communities and countries, a dropout prediction model using machine learning is an active research domain to prevent students from dropping out. However, it is challenging to fulfill the needs of consulting institutes and the office of academic affairs. To the consulting institute, the accuracy in the prediction is of the utmost importance; to the offices of academic affairs and other offices, the reason for dropping out is essential. This paper proposes a Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) system, a hybrid model to predict the students who are about to drop out of the university. The model tries to increase the dropout precision and the dropout recall rate in predicting the dropouts. We then analyzed the reason for dropping out by compressing the feature set with PCA and applying K-means clustering to the compressed feature set. The SDP system showed a precision value of 0.963, which is 0.093 higher than the highest-precision model of the existing works. The dropout recall and F1 scores, 0.766 and 0.808, respectively, were also better than those of gradient boosting by 0.117 and 0.011, making them the highest among the existing works; Then, we classified the reasons for dropping out into four categories: “Employed”, “Did Not Register”, “Personal Issue”, and “Admitted to Other University.” The dropout precision of “Admitted to Other University” was the highest, at 0.672. In post-verification, the SDP system increased counseling efficiency by accurately predicting dropouts with high dropout precision in the “High-Risk” group while including more dropouts in total dropouts. In addition, by predicting the reasons for dropouts and presenting guidelines to each department, the students could receive personalized counseling. © 2023 by the authors.",academic data; big data; dropout precision; dropout recall; hybrid method; imbalanced data processing; K-means clustering; machine learning; principle component analysis,,"Park H.S., An Analysis of the Factors Affecting Local College Freshmen’s Intention of Dropout: Focused on C-College, J.

Therefore, providing knowledge in essential matters is included in every educational curriculum in Thailand. This research has three main objectives: to study the context of academic achievement from the influence of general education courses on students in Rajabhat University, to study student cluster behaviors influenced by general education courses, and to manufacture a predicting model for risk groups of learners affected by general education courses. The demographic data and the sample are 367 students from the Faculty of Science and Technology, Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University, during the academic year 2011–2018, from the Bachelor of Science Program in Computer Science. The research tools were descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics, including Mean, Mode, Median, Minimum, Maximum, K-Means, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, K-NN, Cross-Validation, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The results showed that the risk groups that students will not graduate were significant of two clusters obtained from the research with learning achievement behaviors influenced by general education courses. In addition, the resulting model has the potential and ability to predict the possibility that the learners will not achieve academic achievement at a very high level, with a model accuracy of 87.19%. With the research results that have been studied, researchers can use the results to devise strategies to prevent future dropouts from the higher education system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Academic achievement model; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Machine learning in education; Smart technologies in education,Curricula; Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Predictive analytics; Academic achievement model; Academic achievements; Educational data mining; General education; Learning analytic; Machine learning in education; Machine-learning; Smart technology; Smart technology in education; Technology in educations; Students,"Alhabeeb A., Rowley J., E-learning critical success factors: Comparing perspectives from academic staff and students, Comput.

The theory proposes a comprehensive model that integrates four key dimensions: Knowledge Leverage, Technical Skills Scaling, Soft Skills Scaling, and Personality reshaping. The effectiveness of the theory is evaluated through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental processing, utilizing machine learning algorithms (logistic regression) to gather parameters on learners’ performance in these dimensions in real time. The proposed theory of maximization introduces a dynamic and live monitoring system for learners, which raises alerts when performance declines and provides targeted suggestions for improving specific knowledge or skills. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of the proposed theory in positively impacting at-risk students, with a reduction in at-risk rates by 35% in the Security major and 33% in the Application Development major, compared to a baseline of 48%. Additionally, the proposed theory assists in major selection and provides proactive advising, leading to a learner retention rate of above 90%, significantly higher than the previous rate of 70%, particularly during the early stages of joining the college which also reduces the cost of education. Despite some limitations, such as small sample sizes and privacy issues, the proposed theory has promising implications for the field of smart and sustainable education, providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers. © 2023, International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

The research starts with a historical review of student retention studies and the evolution of predictive models in the field. It highlights the importance of predicting student persistence for educational institutions and individuals. It then describes a dataset from ResearchGate, consisting of anonymized undergraduate student data collected between 2008 and 2018, with 37 features and 4,424 records. Ten machine learning algorithms are considered, with two popular machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classification, being compared in more detail for their performance in predicting student persistence. Evaluation metrics such as prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used. Results show that the Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression in predicting student outcomes, particularly when using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance. Overall, this study contributes to student retention research and provides insights for developing targeted support measures to enhance student success in higher education. © 2024, North American Business Press.

Consequently, to propose this issue, there are several studies under different circumstances or scenarios. For this reason, this research creates four datasets, which take the common variables of easy extraction to the academic process. These variables have been grouped under common characteristics such as general student profile information, admission process information, financial information, academic information, and academic performance information. Thus, the method used in this research is analytical, since it is intended to analyze each subset of data in order to identify the variables with the greatest impact on university dropout. As a result, have been identified the variables with impact on university dropout, For this, a neural network model has been implemented using Python and Keras. In conclusion, the research evidence that academic information is mostly related to college dropout related to university dropout, while admission, financial, and student profile information are not significant in detecting or predicting college dropout. However, with the data obtained, it has been shown that the prediction is not early but in many cases late, since the notes would have already been delivered to students. Therefore, future research is intended to identify the causes that originate academic problems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",data mining; dropout; higher education; machine learning; predictive patterns,Data mining; Education computing; Python; Students; Academic performance; Dropout; Financial information; High educations; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Predictive pattern; Process information; Social problems; Student profiles; Machine learning,"Ekowo M., Palmer I., Predictive Analytics in Higher Education, (2017); Costa A.G., Mattos J.C.B., Primo T.T., Cechinel C., Munoz R., Model for prediction of student dropout in a computer science course, XVI Latin American Conference on Learning Technologies (LACLO), pp. 137-143, (2021)","C.B.

To solve this problem, interactive tutorials using industrial-grade software and hardware to help students' studies was proposed. The tutorials were designed for students to understand how to control a Delta Robot with permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) as the actuators in Twincat 3 and model it on Simulink. For faster learning, an intuitive MATLAB live script was implemented to write the tutorials instead of simple pdfs. Results of the simulations can be used for students as test unit, so the students may get hands-on practice on learning Delta Robot kinematics, PMSM controller, robot design, and integration of Simulink with Twincat 3. Specifically, it was intended to be used in Digital and Servo drives and Spatial Mechanisms and Dynamical Systems classes. This paper tries to solve the problem in the attrition rate of engineering students enrolled in a university. By reducing the attrition rate, more workers with knowledge of robotics can be provided, which in turn supplies the industries demand. © 2023 IEEE.",Delta Robot; MATLAB Simulink; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; PMSM; Simscape; Twincat 3,Dynamical systems; Education computing; Kinematics; Machine design; Permanent magnets; Robots; Simulink; Synchronous motors; Attrition rate; Delta robot; MATLAB/ SIMULINK; Mechatronics education; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Robot kinematics; Simscape; Simulink; Twincat 3; Students,"Lynch K.M., Park F.C., Modern robotics: mechanics, planning, and control, (2017); Wilson M., Implementation of robot systems, (2014); Bouri M., Clavel R., The Linear Delta: Developments and Applications; MacCarthy B.L., Ivanov D., The digital supply chain, (2022); Kovar J., Andrs O., Brezina L., Singule V., Laboratory delta robot for mechatronic education purposes, International Symposium on Power Electronics Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion, pp. 1209-1212, (2012); Taylor S., Shaw S., Thorpe R., Neither market failure nor customer ignorance: The organisational limitations of employee training and development, Human Resource Development in Small Organisations, (2003); Meyer M., Marx S., Engineering Dropouts: A Qualitative Examination of Why Undergraduates Leave Engineering, Journal of Engineering Education, 103, (2014); Erdogdu B., Gokbay I., Karahoca A., INTERACTIVE LEARNABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR CNC MACHINES VIA SIMULATION AND HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT IN CIM LAB, (2006); Thomassian J.-C., Desai A., Kinnicutt P., Interactive Learning In Engineering Education, pp. 137821-137828, (2008); Freeman S., Et al., Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 111, 23, pp. 8410-8415, (2014); Saadah A., Computing The Kinematics Study of a 6 DOF Industrial Manipulator Prototype By Matlab, Recent Innovations in Mechatronics, 7, 1, (2020); Korsoveczki G., Kovacs B., Tihanyi D., Almusawi H.A., Korondi P., IT development of a web-based laboratory system for mechatronical engineering students, 2022 IEEE 9th International Conference on e-Learning in Industrial Electronics (ICELIE), pp. 1-6, (2022); AX5000 Tuning-Guide, (2023); josephtandio27/Delta_Robot_Simulink_Twincat3: Simulation and Tutorial of Delta Robot in Simulink and Twincat 3, (2023); Williams I.I.R.L., The Delta Parallel Robot: Kinematics Solutions, (2022); Niku S.B., Introduction to Robotics: Analysis, Control, Applications, (2020); Pick and Place Robot Using Forward and Inverse Kinematics-MATLAB & Simulink, (2022); PMSM Position Control-MATLAB & Simulink, (2023); Three-Phase PMSM Drive-MATLAB & Simulink, (2023); Vaez-Zadeh S., Control of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors, 1, (2018); When modeling a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine in SimPowerSys, (2023); PMSM Parameterization from Datasheet-MATLAB & Simulink, (2023); Parameterize a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor-MATLAB & Simulink, (2023)","J.W.

This work applies machine learning techniques to develop prediction models that can contribute to the early detection of students at risk of dropping out or not finishing their degree in due time. It also evaluates the best moment for performing the prediction along the student’s enrollment year. The models are built on data of undergraduate students from a Polytechnic University in Portugal, enrolled between 2009 and 2017, comprising academic, social–demographic, and macroeconomic information at three different phases during the first academic year of the students. Five machine learning algorithms are used to train prediction models at each phase, and the most relevant features for the top performing models are identified. Results show that the best models use Random Forest, either incorporating strategies to deal with the imbalanced nature of the data or using such strategies at the data level. The best results are obtained at the end of the first semester, when some information about the academic performance after enrollment is already available. The overall results compare fairly with some similar works that address the early prediction of students’ dropout or academic performance. © 2023 by the authors.",dropout prediction; learning analytics; machine learning; student performance prediction,,"Cvetkovski S., Jorm A.F., Mackinnon A.J., Student psychological distress and degree dropout or completion: A discrete-time, competing risks survival analysis, High.

Numerous research studies have indisputably demonstrated that this issue impacts both developed and developing countries, including India. It is now required to assess it and proceed appropriately based on the results. This study’s objectives included analyzing and evaluating the effects of student dropouts in higher education and investigating how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may help students to continue their education. For dropouts, five colleges were chosen, and data on dropouts were gathered. The administrative team, students, and instructional staff were the target audiences for the questionnaire. Utilizing the information acquired by the five colleges, interviews with targeted individuals, and literature analysis effectively made the study straightforward and more efficient. Information was gathered from colleges of various faculties in terms of gender, programmes, categories, and demographics. The correctness of the information gathered was then evaluated for the quantitative analysis design using the t test, ANOVA test, regression correlation, and descriptive analysis. Most of the findings were in line with expectations. Results were found to be more than expected in terms of gender and demographics. Furthermore, in accordance with the results of the analysis, AI and ML approaches were examined to improve college student retention. Then, it was discovered that both of these methods were effective and trustworthy for preventing dropouts in today's world, including India. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Artificial intelligence; Category; Demographic; Dropout; Gender; Machine learning; Programme; Retention,,"Leathwood C., O'connell P., ‘It's a struggle’: the construction of the ‘new student’in higher education, J Educ Policy, 18, 6, pp. 597-615, (2003); Kahu E.R., Framing student engagement in higher education, Stud High Educ, 38, 5, pp. 758-773, (2013); Brown G.A., Bull J., Pendlebury M., Assessing student learning in higher education, (2013); Leslie L.L., Brinkman P.T., Student price response in higher education: the student demand studies, J High Educ, 58, 2, pp. 181-204, (1987); Robotham D., Julian C., Stress and the higher education student: a critical review of the literature, J Furth High Educ, 30, 2, pp. 107-117, (2006); Sharpe R., Benfield G., The student experience of e-learning in higher education, Brookes eJ Learn Teach, 1, 3, pp. 1-9, (2005); Wright G.B., Student-centered learning in higher education, Int J Teach Learn High Educ, 23, 1, pp. 92-97, (2011); Guo P., Et al., A review of project-based learning in higher education: student outcomes and measures, Int J Educ Res, 102, (2020); Youssef A.B., Dahmani M., The impact of ICT on student performance in higher education: direct effects, indirect effects and organisational change, RUSC Univ Knowl Soc J, 5, 1, pp. 45-56, (2008); Dawson S., Heathcote L., Poole G., Harnessing ICT potential: the adoption and analysis of ICT systems for enhancing the student learning experience, Int J Educ Manag, 24, pp. 116-128, (2010); Sarkar S., The role of information and communication technology (ICT) in higher education for the 21st century, Science, 1, 1, pp. 30-41, (2012); Siragusa L., Dixon K., Planned behaviour: Student attitudes towards the use of ICT interactions in higher education, In: Hello!

Given these high consequences and the surge of the problem due to COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we propose a methodology to design, develop, and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting dropout in school systems. In this methodology, we introduce necessary steps to develop a robust model to estimate the individual risk of each student to drop out of school. As advancement from previous research, this proposal focuses on analyzing individual trajectories of students, incorporating the student situation at school, family, among other levels, changes, and accumulation of events to predict dropout. Following the methodology, we create a model for the Chilean case based on data available mostly through administrative data from the educational system, and according to known factors associated with school dropout. Our results are better than those from previous research with a relevant sample size, with a predictive capability 20% higher for the actual dropout cases. Also, in contrast to previous work, the including non-individual dimensions results in a substantive contribution to the prediction of leaving school. We also illustrate applications of the model for Chilean case to support public policy decision making such as profiling schools for qualitative studies of pedagogic practices, profiling students’ dropout trajectories and simulating scenarios. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Data science applications in education; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Student retention,,"Adelman M., Haimovich F., Ham A., Vazquez E., Predicting school dropout with administrative data: New evidence from Guatemala and Honduras, Education Economics, 26, 4, pp. 356-372, (2018); Anderson S., Uribe M., Valenzuela J.P., Reforming public education in Chile: The creation of local education services, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, (2021); Bentejac C., Csorgo A., Martinez-Munoz G., A comparative analysis of gradient boosting algorithms, Artificial Intelligence Review, 54, 3, pp. 1937-1967, (2021); Bergstra J., Bardenet R., Bengio Y., Kegl B., Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2011); Boniolo P., Najmias C., School dropout and school lag in Argentina: A social classes approach, Tempo Social, 30, 3, pp. 217-247, (2018); Browne M., Análisis del Sistema de Administración Delegada creada por el DL N<sup>o</sup> 3166 de 1980, Ministerio De Educación-SETP., (2017); Buenadicha C., Galdon G., Hermosilla M., Loewe D., Pombo C., La gestión ética De Los Datos, (2019); Chen T., Guestrin C., XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System, Proceedings of the 22Nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 785-794, (2016); Dos Santos E.M., Sabourin R., Maupin P., Overfitting cautious selection of classifier ensembles with genetic algorithms, Information Fusion, 10, 2, pp. 150-162, (2009); Dussaillant F., Deserción escolar en Chile,  18, pp. 1-18, (2017); Ecker-Lyster M., Niileksela C., Keeping Students on Track to Graduate: A Synthesis of School Dropout Trends, Prevention, and Intervention Initiatives, The Journal of at-Risk Issues, 19, 2, pp. 24-31, (2016); A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise, Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 226-231, (1996); Gil A.J., Antelm-Lanzat A.M., Cacheiro-Gonzalez M.L., Perez-Navio E., School dropout factors: A teacher and school manager perspective, Educational Studies, 45, 6, pp. 756-770, (2019); Hirakawa Y., Taniguchi K., School dropout in primary schools in rural Cambodia: School-level and student-level factors, Asia Pacific Journal of Education, 41, 3, pp. 527-542, (2021); Hofter R.H., Private health insurance and utilization of health services in Chile, Applied Economics, 38, 4, pp. 423-439, (2006); Jaderberg M., Dalibard V., Osindero S., Czarnecki W.M., Donahue J., Razavi A., Vinyals O., Green T., Dunning I., Simonyan K., Fernando C., Kavukcuoglu K., Population Based Training of Neural Networks, Arxiv, 9846, (2017); Jena M., Dehuri S., DecisionTree for Classification and Regression: A State-of-the Art Review, Informatica, 44, 4, (2020); Kattan R.B., Szekely M., Analyzing Upper Secondary Education Dropout in Latin America through a Cohort Approach, Journal of Education and Learning, 6, 4, pp. 12-39, (2017); Ke G., Meng Q., Finley T., Wang T., Chen W., Ma W., Ye Q., Liu T.-Y., LightGBM: A highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree, In Proceedings of the 31St International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS'17).

This research harnesses the power of explainable AI to predict and classify students based on their likelihood of not completing their degrees on time. Utilizing synthetic data generated via a Bayesian network, we used predictive models that categorize students into four distinct risk profiles. This clarity in prediction not only illuminates the underlying causes of academic delays but also empowers faculty, advisors, and student support services with actionable insights. The goal of this research is to facilitate timely interventions, tailored support, and seamless transitions for students transferring between universities, ensuring more students can realize their academic aspirations within expected time frames. © 2023 IEEE.",academic performance; at-risk students; classification models; Machine learning; student attrition,Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Academic performance; At-risk student; Classification models; Completion time; Machine-learning; Power; Pressung; Student attrition; Student-based; Synthetic data; Students,"Alturki S., Hulpus I., Stuckenschmidt H., Predicting Academic Outcomes: A Survey from 2007 Till 2018, Technology, Knowledge and Learning, 27, 1, pp. 275-307, (2020); Li Y., Allen J., Casillas A., Relating psychological and social factors to academic performance: A longitudinal investigation of highpoverty middle school students, Journal of Adolescence, 56, (2017); Acid S., De Campos L.M., Castellano J.G., Learning bayesian network classifiers: Searching in a space of partially directed acyclic graphs, Machine Learning, 59, 3, pp. 213-235, (2005); Lau E., Sun L., Yang Q., Modelling, prediction and classification of student academic performance using artificial neural networks, Sn Applied Sciences, 1, (2019); Adejo O., Thomas T., Predicting student academic performance using multi-model heterogeneous ensemble approach, Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 10, (2017); Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., Dukhan S., Forecasting Learner Attrition for Student Success at a South African University, (2020); Tinto V., Drop-Outs from Higher Education: A Theoretical Synthesis of Recent Research, Review of Educational Research, 45, (1975); Abed T., Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., A prediction model to improve student placement at a south african higher education institution, International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference, (2020); Mngadi N., Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., A Conceptual Model to Identify Vulnerable Undergraduate Learners at Higher-Education Institution, pp. 1-8, (2020); Bokana G., Tewari D., Determinants of Student Success at a South African University: An Econometric Analysis, Anthropologist, 17, pp. 259-277, (2014); Dowd A.C., Coury T., The Effect of Loans on the Persistence and Attainment of Community College Students, Research in Higher Education, 47, 1, pp. 33-62, (2006); Maitra S., Eshrak S., Swapon Md., Al-Sakin A., Prediction of Academic Performance Applying NNs: A Focus on Statistical Feature-Shedding and Lifestyle, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 10, (2019); Nimy E., Mosia M., Chibaya C., Identifying At-Risk Students for Early Intervention-A Probabilistic Machine Learning Approach, Applied Sciences, 13, 6, (2023); Alyahyan E., Dustegor D., Predicting academic success in highereducation: Literature review and best practices, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); Asif R., Hina S., Haque S., Predicting student academic performance using data mining methods, International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, 17, 17, pp. 187-191, (2017); Sperry R.A., Predicting First-Year Student Success in Learning Communities: The Power of Pre-College Variables, Learning Communities: Research Practice, 3, 1, (2015); Bhattacharya R., Bhattacharya B., Psychological factors affecting students academic performance in higher education among students, International Journal for Research and Development in Technology, 4, 1, pp. 63-71, (2015); Krumrei Mancuso E., Newton F., Kim E., Wilcox D., Psychosocial Factors Predicting First-Year College Student Success, Journal of College Student Development, 54, pp. 247-266, (2013); Kalenga R.C., Samukelisiwe M., Exploring Psycho-social Challenges of Underperforming Students in the Faculty of Education at the University of KwaZulu Natal in South Africa, The Anthropologist, 19, 3, pp. 749-761, (2015); Fatima M., Shafique M., Health and academic performance of university students: Direct and mediating effect of social capital, Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences (PJCSS), 9, 2, pp. 357-379, (2015); Joshi S., Gangwani P., A Deep Learning Approach for Modeling of Geothermal Energy Prediction, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, 18, (2020); Hasan R., Palaniappan S., Raziff A., Mahmood S., Sarker K., Student Academic Performance Prediction by using Decision Tree Algorithm, 4th International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences (ICCOINS), (2018); Burman I., Som S., Predicting Students Academic Performance Using Support Vector Machine, Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AICAI), pp. 756-759, (2019); Powers D., Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Factor to ROC, Informedness, Markedness Correlation, Machine Learning Technology, 2, (2008); Dutt A., Ismail M., Can We Predict Student Learning Performance from Lms Data?

However, very little research has explored individual feature importance and their distinctive roles in predicting individual outcomes. In this study, we compare the predictive performance of two widely used machine learning models, logistic regression, and random forest, and use the SMOTE to improve the model performance. We analyze the feature importance in both aggregated form and their varied impact on individual predictions using a real-world student persistence dataset.

Student dropout prediction is a growing research area since dropouts have financial, social, and national consequences. To deal with this issue, we examined the performance of ten machine learning algorithms with different feature sets in predicting university student dropout. Used algorithms are: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Stacking Classifier, Adaboost, XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Multi Layer Perceptrons. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) balancing algorithm is used in the training process, to balance training data since the used dataset has an imbalanced nature. On the student dataset from Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, we obtained 92 % accuracy on the XGBoost algorithm with a sub-feature set. We showed that the selected data features are as important as the selected method. Considering different performance metrics other than accuracy for imbalanced data is important. Having economic and historical score data increases accuracy. We also have seen that XGBoost and Random Forrest algorithms were the best for this task. © 2023 IEEE.",educational data mining; machine learning; student dropout prediction; university dropout,Adaptive boosting; Balancing; Data mining; Decision trees; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Students; Support vector machines; Educational data mining; Features sets; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Performance; Research areas; Student dropout prediction; University dropout; University students; Forecasting,"Kopnina H., Education for the future? critical evaluation of education for sustainable development goals, Journal of Environmental Education, 51, (2020); Hallsten M., Is education a risky investment? the scarring effect of university dropout in Sweden, European Sociological Review, 33, (2017); Mesaric D.S.J., Decision trees for predicting the academic success of students, Croatian Operational Research Review, 7, (2016); Ortiz-Lozano J.M., Rua-Vieites A., Bilbao-Calabuig P., Casadesus-Fa M., University student retention: Best time and data to identify undergraduate students at risk of dropout, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 57, (2020); Hakkarainen A.M., Holopainen L.K., Savolainen H.K., A five-year follow-up on the role of educational support in preventing dropout from upper secondary education in finland, Journal of Learning Disabilities, 48, (2015); Miranda M.A., Guzman J., Analisis de la desercion de estudiantes universitarios usando tecnicas de mineria de datos, Formacion Universitaria, 10, (2017); Pek R.Z., Ozyer S.T., Elhage T., Ozyer T., Alhajj R., The role of machine learning in identifying students at-risk and minimizing failure, IEEE Access, 11, (2023); Rodriguez-Pineda M., Zamora-Araya J.A., College student dropout: Cohort study about possible causes, Uniciencia, 35, (2021); Mena M., Godoy W., Tisalema S., Analysis of causes of early dropout of students higher education, Minerva, 2, (2021); Alarape M.A., Ameen A.O., Adewole K.S., Hybrid students' academic performance and dropout prediction models using recursive feature elimination technique, (2022); Hamim T., Benabbou F., Sael N., Student profile modeling using boosting algorithms, International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies, 17, (2022); Nuanmeesri S., Poomhiran L., Chopvitayakun S., Kadmateekarun P., Improving dropout forecasting during the covid-19 pandemic through feature selection and multilayer perception neural network, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 12, (2022); Alvarado-Uribe J., Mejia-Almada P., Herrera A.L.M., Molontay R., Hilliger I., Hegde V., Gallegos J.E.M., Diaz R.A.R., Ceballos H.G., Student dataset from tecnologico de monterrey in mexico to predict dropout in higher education, Data, 7, 9, (2022); Lin W.J., Chen J.J., Class-imbalanced classifiers for highdimensional data, Briefings in bioinformatics, 14, 1, pp. 13-26, (2013); Lopez V., Fernandez A., Garcia S., Palade V., Herrera F., An insight into classification with imbalanced data: Empirical results and current trends on using data intrinsic characteristics, Information sciences, 250, pp. 113-141, (2013)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85177596449,,

There is a growing number of university students using AI like ChatGPT and Bard to support their academic experience. Much of the AI in higher education research to date has focused on academic integrity and matters of authorship; yet, there may be unintended consequences beyond these concerns for students. That is, there may be people who reduce their formal social interactions while using these tools. This study evaluates 387 university students and their relationship to–and with–artificial intelligence large-language model-based tools. Using structural equation modelling, the study finds evidence that while AI chatbots designed for information provision may be associated with student performance, when social support, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, and sense of belonging are considered it has a net negative effect on achievement. This study tests an AI-specific form of social support, and the cost it may pose to student success, wellbeing, and retention. Indeed, while AI chatbot usage may be associated with poorer social outcomes, human-substitution activity that may be occurring when a student chooses to seek support from an AI rather than a human (e.g. a librarian, professor, or student advisor) may pose interesting learning and teaching policy implications. We explore the implications of this from the lens of student success and belonging. © 2024 The Author(s).

Information and communication technology (ICT) is adopted by educational institutions; one such instance is video interaction in flipped teaching. ICT-based learning generates a huge amount of data that can be utilized to better understand student behavior and improve students learning. Predicting students’ academic performance is essential to take proactive measures to improve student learning and reduce the risk of student dropout and failure. This study aims to use video learning analysis and data mining approaches to predict student academic achievement and identify the factors affecting their performance. For this purpose, the dataset containing records of 326 students from a higher education institution (HEI) is used which contains records from SIS, Moodle, and eDify. This study advocates the use of a balanced dataset and optimized feature set to obtain better performance for students’ academic performance prediction. Several machine learning and deep learning models are applied to analyze their performance against the original dataset, balanced dataset, and balanced dataset with the optimized feature set. Experimental results demonstrate decision tree classifier outperforms with an accuracy of 99.06% with a balanced dataset and optimized feature set.

Our focus was on algorithms capable of effectively handling imbalanced data. To tackle class imbalance, we employed the SMOTE resampling technique. We applied a range of algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), as well as boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), CatBoost (CB), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LB). To enhance the models' performance, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. Additionally, we employed the Isolation Forest (IF) method to identify outliers or anomalies within the dataset. Notably, our findings indicate that boosting algorithms, particularly LightGBM and CatBoost with Optuna, outperformed traditional classification methods. Our study's generalizability to other contexts is constrained due to its reliance on a single dataset, with inherent limitations. Nevertheless, this research provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms for predicting student dropout and academic success. By benchmarking these algorithms, our project offers guidance to both researchers and practitioners in their choice of suitable approaches for similar predictive tasks. © The Author(s) 2024.",Boosting algorithms;

Identifying students who are at risk of dropping out early allows for timely interventions and support systems to be implemented, thereby enhancing student retention rates. This study focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze student behavior and predict early dropout in university settings. The objective of this research is to develop a machine learning-based predictive model that utilizes student behavioral data to identify potential indicators of early dropout. Various aspects of student behavior, including academic performance, engagement, course participation, and campus involvement, are considered as input features for the predictive model. By analyzing these behavioral patterns, the model aims to accurately predict which students are at higher risk of dropping out in the early stages of their university journey. A comprehensive dataset is collected, encompassing demographic information, academic records, extracurricular activities, and other relevant variables. To extract useful features from the dataset, feature engineering approaches are employed, which are then used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Various algorithms, such as support vector machines, feed forward neural networks, random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, KNN and ensemble methods are implemented and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for early dropout prediction. The findings of this study have substantial implications for higher education since they provide new understanding of the relationships between student academic behavior and the risk of dropping out. The suggested predictive model provides institutions with a useful tool to proactively identify students who may be at danger of early dropout, enabling the implementation of tailored interventions and support programs aimed at improving student retention and overall academic accomplishment. © 2023 IEEE.",early dropout prediction; higher education; machine learning; Student behavior analysis; student retention; university settings,Adaptive boosting; Education computing; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Random forests; Support vector regression; Behavior analysis; Early dropout prediction; High educations; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Student behavior analyse; Student retention; Students' behaviors; University settings; Students,"Skalka D.M., Automated Assessment and Microlearning Units as Predictors of At-Risk Students and Students' Outcomes in the Introductory Programming Courses, Applied Sciences, 10, 13, (2020); Jovial Niyogisubizo L.L.E.N.E.M.P.C.N., Predicting student's dropout in university classes using two-layer ensemble machine learning approach: A novel stacked generalization, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, (2022); Lee S.C.J.Y., The Machine Learning-Based Dropout Early Warning System for Improving the Performance of Dropout Prediction, Applied Sciences, 9, 15, (2019); Rodriguez P.V.A.D.L.E.A., A methodology to design, develop, and evaluate machine learning models for predicting dropout in school systems: The case of Chile, Educ Inf Technol, (2023); Sunbok Lee J.Y.C., The Machine Learning-Based Dropout Early Warning System for Improving the Performance of Dropout Prediction, Applied Sciences, (2019); Matz B.C.P.H.D.C.D., Using machine learning to predict student retention from socio-demographic characteristics and app-based engagement metrics, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Albreiki B., Zaki N., Alashwal H., A Systematic Literature Review of Student' Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques, Education Sciences, 11, (2021); Swati Verma R.K.Y.K.K., A Scalable Machine Learning-based Ensemble Approach to Enhance the Prediction Accuracy for Identifying Students at-Risk, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, (2022); Sarker I., Machine Learning: AlgorithmsReal-World Applications and Research Directions, SN COMPUT.

A common task has been predicting students at risk of dropping out for the necessary interventions to be made. However, issues of discrimination by these predictive models based on protected attributes of students have recently been raised. An important question that is constantly asked is: should the protected attributes be excluded from the learning analytics (LA) models in order to ensure fairness? In this article, we aimed at answering questions that if we exclude the protected attributes from the LA models, does the exclusion ensure fairness as it supposedly should? Does the exclusion affect the performance of the LA model? If so, why? We found answers to these questions and went further to explain why. We built machine learning models and performed empirical evaluations using a three-year dropout data for a particular program in a large Australian university. We found that excluding or including the protected attributes had marginal effect on predictive performance and fairness. Perhaps not surprisingly, our findings suggest that the effect of including or excluding protected attributes is a function of how they relate with the prediction outcome. More specifically, if a protected attribute is correlated with the target label and proves to be an important feature, then their inclusion or exclusion would have effect on the performance and fairness and vice versa. Our findings provide insightful information that can be used by relevant stakeholders to make well-informed decisions.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.",Dropout prediction; explainable AI; fairness in education; learning analytics (LA),Artificial intelligence; Biological systems; Digital storage; Education computing; Job analysis; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Analytic modeling; Australia; Biological system modeling; Dropout prediction; Explainable AI; Fairness in education; Learning analytic; Performance; Predictive models; Task analysis; Students,"Yu R., Li Q., Fischer C., Doroudi S., Xu D., Towards accurate and fair prediction of college success: Evaluating different sources of student data, Proc. 13th Int.

Pre-test post-test experimental design with control group was used as the method in the study. A total of 64 (32 experimental, 32 control) second-year students studying at the universities in Almaty, Kazakhstan participated in the study. The participants were divided into two groups as control and experimental groups. Foreign language Achievement Test and Motivation Scale for foreign language were used as data collection tools. In the research, in the experimental group, applications were carried out with digital tools and artificial intelligence on the basis of project-based learning approach. In the control group, the foreign language course was carried out with the traditional teaching approach. The application lasted eight weeks in total. The results of the analysis showed that the applications carried out in the experimental group had positive effects on the students' foreign language course achievement and motivation. On the basis of the project-based learning approach, digital tools and artificial intelligence applications not only contributed positively to students' achievement and motivation, but also ensured the retention of what was learned. Finally, suggestions for future research were developed in the study. © 2023 International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

Unfortunately, many students fail to meet expected academic benchmarks, leading to altered career paths or university dropouts. This issue is particularly pronounced in the early stages of higher education, highlighting the need for the instructors of these foundational courses to have access to simple yet effective tools for the early identification of students at high risk of academic failure. In this study, we propose a streamlined conceptual model inspired by the Model of Human Behavior (MHB) to which we have incorporated two dimensions: capacity and willingness. These dimensions are assessed through the definition of three variables: Prior Academic Performance (PAP), Personality and Academic Engagement, whose measurements can easily be obtained by the instructors. Furthermore, we outline a Machine Learning (ML) process that higher education instructors can use to create their own tailored models in order to predict AP and identify risk groups with high levels of transparency and interpretability. The application of our approach to a sample of 322 Spanish undergraduates studying two mathematical subjects at a Spanish university demonstrates its potential to detect failure early in the semester with a precision that is comparable with that of more complex models found in literature. Our tailored model identified that capacity was the primary predictor of AP, with a gain-to-baseline improvement of 21%, and the willingness variables increasing this to 27%. This approach is consistent over time. Implications for instructors are discussed and an open prediction and analysis tool is developed. © The Author(s) 2024.",Academic performance; eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); Machine Learning (ML); Observational study; Student dropout,,"Affuso G., Zannone A., Esposito C., Pannone M., Miranda M.C., De Angelis G., Aquilar S., Dragone M., Bacchini D., The effects of teacher support, parental monitoring, motivation and self-efficacy on academic performance over time, Eur J Psychol Educ, 38, 1, pp. 1-23, (2023); Albreiki B., Zaki N., Alashwal H., A systematic literature review of student’performance prediction using machine learning techniques, Educ Sci, 11, 9, (2021); Alhadabi A., Karpinski A.C., Grit, self-efficacy, achievement orientation goals, and academic performance in University students, Int J Adolesc Youth, 25, 1, pp. 519-535, (2020); Alshamaila Y., Alsawalqah H., Aljarah I., Habib M., Faris H., Alshraideh M., Salih B.A., An automatic prediction of students’ performance to support the university education system: A deep learning approach, Multimedia Tools and Applications, pp. 1-28, (2024); Avia M., Sanz J., Sanchez-Bernardos M., Martinez-Arias M., Silva F., Grana J., The five-factor model—II.

In advancing these efforts, laws and policies govern these environments placing protections, standards, and developmental opportunities for higher education, students, faculty, and even the nation-state. Nonetheless, evidence of educational restrictions, encumbered actions, and archaic approaches pervades the legal literature and case law demonstrating that these laws and policies do not always function well in evolving and emerging technology spaces. To examine these laws and policies of student privacy, the author employs the combination of a critical policy analysis, which derives from critical social research as a means to explore discourse and policy through drawing out the policy contexts, texts, and consequences, and Flood's liberating systems theory, which directs the analysis to a problem-solving approach by examining the policy discourse from a systems-thinking lens. Based on a review of 184 court cases, 74 policies from a diversified representation of US states/territories, and seven developed nations or multi-nation consortia, this examination illuminates how context and text such as the type and setting of the privacy matter (eg, various freedom of information acts, educational records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union) presents opportunities for protections and standardization efforts; however, they also illustrate significant protection gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around the type and degree of data subject consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. While the extant literature already supports aspects of these findings, it does not account for this holistic view of these three privacy vulnerabilities—especially in light of the principles to which these laws purport to achieve. Moreover, the three identified privacy vulnerabilities suggest overlooked inclusion of two overarching privacy concepts—transparency and equity. This study recommends that key actors in the policy construction realm (ie, university leaders, policymakers, and judges) should engage in analyses, dialogue, and consideration about transparency and equity by considering contemporary privacy problems in the contexts of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity as a way to improve transparent and equitable policies in these areas rather than exacerbating the privacy dilemmas already in place. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are well documented evidence of privacy protections for education and health records, but they fail to offer sufficient protections for students as data subjects with emerging technologies. Existing federal-level laws in the United States do not offer a systematic or uniform approach in the manner that data users obtain consent, so data subjects are largely unaware of what is being consented. Other than matters of consent, policy strategies based on student privacy laws (ie, voluntary consensus standards, basic practices to maintain privacy, an ethics review board, data/record retention and destruction, and data sanitation of equipment) are significant and informative largely from the university-perspective, not the students as data subjects. What this paper adds A new comprehensive examination of US laws including statutes, regulations, and cases as well as seven key nation-state or national consortia laws—especially the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and selected state laws in the United States, which offer consistent and greater student privacy protections. Insights about the principles designed among the laws, which centre around their application, essentiality, consent, and security. Attention to areas in which student privacy laws still present privacy concerns, but specifically identifying issues of significant gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around levels and types of consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. Implications for practice and/or policy Data subject consent should be established and consistent– whether an opt-out provision, opt-in provision, or some extensive engagement. Student privacy policies should incorporate principles of transparency and equity for data subjects and data treatment. Policymakers should consider now how the intersections of data subject privacy matters shall be addressed in the context of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.",critical policy analysis;

This work proposes using gradient boosting on decision trees to generate a high quality predictive model on data for almost 7,000 students of the University of Brasília, and applying SHAP to extract meaningful and comprehensive information on student attrition from it. Initial results indicate a strong predictive accuracy with over 90% recall and 85% f-score values and the SHAP analysis highlighted the importance of specific academic features, such as the student's performance on specific courses and all around performance during a period. More interestingly, the analysis provided insights on non academic features like age, commute time and whether the student enrolled through a social or racial quota or not. This may lead to better models and enhancing the discussions and changes on educational policies in the institution such as modifying a curricular structure or pursuing student housing closer to campuses. © 2023 IEEE.",catboost; educational data mining; machine learning; SHAP; student attrition,Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Students; Catboost; Educational data mining; High educations; Higher education institutions; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Predictive models; SHAP; Student attrition; Underlying cause; Machine learning,"Santos F.S., De Almeida N.F., A quarta missao da universidade: Internacionalizac ao universitária na sociedade do conhecimento, (2012); Lobo M., Panorama da evasao no ensino superior brasileiro: Aspectos gerais das causas e soluc oes 2012, Associac ao Brasileira de Mantenedoras de Ensino Superior.

Using predictive modeling can be instrumental for this task, as a means to identify dropouts proactively on the basis of student characteristics and their academic performance. To enhance these predictions, textual student feedback also might be relevant; this article proposes a hybrid decision support framework that combines predictive modeling with student segmentation efforts. A real-life data set from a French higher education institution, containing information of 14,391 students and 62,545 feedback documents, confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework, in terms of the area under the curve and top decile lift, compared with various benchmarks. In contributing to decision support system research, this study (1) proposes a new framework for automatic, data-driven segmentation of students based on textual data; (2) compares multiple text representation methods and confirms that incorporating student textual feedback data improves the predictive performance of student dropout models; and (3) establishes useful insights to help decision-makers anticipate and manage student dropout behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Decision support framework; doc2vec; Learning analytics; Segmentation; Student dropout prediction; Textual data,Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Decision making; Decision support systems; Education computing; Information management; Students; Academic institutions; Decision support framework; Doc2vec; High educations; Learning analytic; Predictive models; Segmentation; Student dropout prediction; Student's characteristics; Textual data; Forecasting,"Thammasiri D., Delen D., Meesad P., Kasap N., A critical assessment of imbalanced class distribution problem: the case of predicting freshmen student attrition, Expert Syst.

Students have different reasons for dropping out but the main ones are related to difficulty in learning the content, the structure proposed by the course, and the lack of financial resources. Problem: Besides understanding the motive for students completely abandoned their studies, the most important problem is identifying which groups of students are at risk of dropping out. However, studies focus essentially on categorical indicators, i.e., binary results that denote whether a student is or is not in the risk group. This type of analysis is important, but, it does not present the variation in the student’s performance during their academic life. Solution: Creating a score using machine learning techniques (KNN) can provide an instrument to measure how close the student is or not to the dropout group. Theory: We used Organizational knowledge creation to make available and expand knowledge about dropping and to provide inputs for the creation of a knowledge system. Method: The experimental study is quantitative and it was performed from the execution of KNN and its validation from statistical analyses. Results: With equation developed and accuracy of 87% with KNN, was possible to develop a drop out risk score with values between 0 and 1,000, where the closer to 0, the greater the probability of the student to drop out. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The main contribution of the paper is to provide a new method to assist in the analysis of higher education dropout in Information System and other courses. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Dropout from Higher Education; KNN; Machine Learning; Score,Curricula; Drops; Information systems; Information use; Knowledge management; Machine learning; Drop-out; Dropout from high education; Financial resources; High educations; KNN; Machine-learning; Performance; Risk groups; Score; Social-economic; Students,"Aha D.W., Kibler D., Albert M.K., Instance-based learning algorithms, Machine Learning, 6, 1, pp. 37-66, (1991); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting student dropout in higher education, (2016); da Cruz R.C., Juliano R.C., Souza A.C.C., Souza F.C.M., Desenvolvimento de um Score para análise de risco de evasão de estudantes do Ensino Superior baseado em Aprendizado de Máquina, Anais do Computer on the Beach, 13, pp. 142-148, (2022); da Silva H., Adeodato P., A data mining approach for preventing undergraduate students retention, The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1-8, (2012); Davok D.F., Bernard R.P., Avaliação dos índices de evasão nos cursos de graduação da Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC, (2016); de Almeida Teodoro L., Kappel M.A.A., Aplicação de Técnicas de Aprendizado de Máquina para Predição de Risco de Evasão Escolar em Instituições Públicas de Ensino Superior no Brasil, Revista Brasileira de Informática na Educação, 28, pp. 838-863, (2020); de Brito B.C.P., de Mello R.F.L., Alves G., Identificação de Atributos Relevantes na Evasão no Ensino Superior Público Brasileiro, Anais do XXXI Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática na Educação, pp. 1032-1041, (2020); Junior J., Noronha R., Kaestner C., Criação e Seleção de Atributos Aplicados na Previsão da Evasão de Curso em Alunos de Graduação, Anais do Computer on the Beach, pp. 61-70, (2017); Lanes M., Alcantara C., Predição de Alunos com Risco de Evasão: estudo de caso usando mineração de dados, Brazilian Symposium on Computers in Education (Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática na Educação-SBIE), 29, (2018); Mani I., Zhang I., kNN approach to unbalanced data distributions: a case study involving information extraction, Proceedings of workshop on learning from imbalanced datasets, 126, (2003); Altos índices de desistência na graduação revelam fragilidade do ensino médio, (2016); Menolli A., Horita F., L Dias J.J., Coelho R., BI–based Methodology for Analyzing Higher Education: A Case Study of Dropout Phenomenon in Information Systems Courses, XVI Brazilian Symposium on Information Systems, pp. 1-8, (2020); Ramyachitra D., Manikandan P., Imbalanced dataset classification and solutions: a review, International Journal of Computing and Business Research (IJCBR), 5, 4, pp. 1-29, (2014); Sampaio H., Ensino superior no Brasil: o setor privado, Cadernos de Pesquisa, (2000); Saraiva D.V., Pereira S.S.L., Braga R.B., de Oliveira C.T., Análise de Agrupamentos para Caracterização de Indicadores de Evasão, Anais do XXIX Workshop sobre Educação em Computação, pp. 238-247, (2021); Saraiva J., Dantas V., Rodrigues A., Compreendendo a Evasão em uma Década no Curso Sistemas de Informação à luz de fatores humanos e sociais, Anais do IV Workshop sobre Aspectos Sociais, Humanos e Econômicos de Software, pp. 21-30, (2019); Wirth R., Hipp J., CRISP-DM: Towards a standard process model for data mining, Proceedings of the 4th international conference on the practical applications of knowledge discovery and data mining, 1, pp. 29-40, (2000); Wohlin C., Runeson P., Host M., Ohlsson M.C., Regnell B., Wesslen A., Experimentation in Software Engineering: An Introduction (1st. ed.), (2012)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165979571,,

So, given the importance of this problem, a lot of literature, in the areas of computer science, psychology and statistics, was produced with the intention of predicting and trying to mitigate dropout rates in higher education. Aiming to address this problem this work makes an analysis of the literature about the topic and produce a statistical analysis of a dataset provided by INEP (National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira) that brings indicators of dropout of undergraduate courses from universities in Brazil, and a comparison was made with specific data from engineering courses at UNB using two machine learning methods: neural networks and regression. Observing the results of the model made, they show that the model could not surpass the models in the literature, however the analysis carried out revealed interesting data on dropout rates in Brazilian higher education and it is also noticed that dropout increased considerably in the pandemic period. In view of this, predictive models are very useful methods for identifying students at risk of dropout  © 2023 IEEE.",Dropout; Prediction; Students; University,Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Dropout; Engineering course; High educations; Machine learning methods; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Two machines; Undergraduate Courses; University; Students,"Tete M., Sousa M., Santana T., Fellipe S., Predictive models for higher education dropout: A systematic literature review, Education Policy Analysis Archives, 30, (2022); Flores V., Heras S., Julian V., Comparison of predictive models with balanced classes using the smote method for the forecast of student dropout in higher education, Electronics, 11, 3, (2022); Lopez-Angulo Y., Saez-Delgado F., Mella-Norambuena J., Bernardo A.B., Diaz-Mujica A., Predictive model of the dropout intention of chilean university students, Frontiers in Psychology, 13, (2023); Brandao I.V., Da Costa J.P.C.L., Santos G.A., Praciano B.J.G., Junior F.C., De Junior R.T.S., Classification and predictive analysis of educational data to improve the quality of distance learning courses, 2019 Workshop on Communication Networks and Power Systems (WCNPS), pp. 1-6, (2019); Shafiq D.A., Marjani M., Habeeb R.A.A., Asirvatham D., Student retention using educational data mining and predictive analytics: A systematic literature review, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 72480-72503, (2022); Barros T.M., Souza Neto P.A., Silva I., Guedes L.A., Predictive models for imbalanced data: A school dropout perspective, Education Sciences, 9, 4, (2019); Burgos C., Campanario M.L., De La Pena D., Lara J.A., Lizcano D., Martinez M.A., Data mining for modeling students' performance: A tutoring action plan to prevent academic dropout, Computers Electrical Engineering, 66, pp. 541-556, (2018); Rosa C.D.M., Santos F.F.T.D., Milani E.A., The prediction of graduation and dropout in a public university from a logistic model, Educação, 46, pp. e921-e921, (2021); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of educational research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Bello F.A., Kohler J., Hinrechsen K., Araya V., Hidalgo L., Jara J.L., Using machine learning methods to identify significant variables for the prediction of first-year informatics engineering students dropout, 2020 39th International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society (SCCC), pp. 1-5, (2020); Limsathitwong K., Tiwatthanont K., Yatsungnoen T., Dropout prediction system to reduce discontinue study rate of information technology students, 2018 5th International Conference on Business and Industrial Research (ICBIR), pp. 110-114, (2018)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182262640,,

Students leave engineering school for many reasons, ranging from low math preparation to a low sense of belonging in engineering, which can be viewed through the Situated Expectancy Value Theory (EVT) framework of academic decision-making. Prior work has found many strong predictors of persistence from first-semester data, including EVT variables, but when it comes to identifying interventions, it might be better to identify predictors from earlier in the first semester. In this study, we attempted to predict student persistence using two machine learning techniques, neural networks and decision trees, and only using early data from the beginning of the first semester (EVT survey data, standardized test scores, demographic data, and Pell eligibility). We found that decision trees were better able to predict retention rates from the beginning of the semester than neural networks, as neural networks struggled to find clear signals that indicated if a student was likely to drop out of engineering school. Grouping students together who are at-risk of leaving engineering school from the beginning of the semester will allow instructors and advisors to focus their attention on those groups, and therefore improve retention rates. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,Decision trees; Engineering education; Forecasting; Machine learning; Decisions makings; Engineering schools; Expectancy-value theory; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Research papers; Retention rate; Sense of belonging; Student persistences; Student retention; Students,"Lewis K.

Adoption of AI in traditional education has been lower than expected due to several reasons, including a lack of understanding of the processes behind it, which is fatal for situations like student dropout. An ideal AI tool for this problem would provide individually tailored interventions towards student retention, but that would require a much deeper understanding of what entails a successful intervention. Using a novel methodology for feature comparison between subpopulations, we found that the features obtained through our machine learning models coincide with both the opinion of interviewed mentors/tutors and with independently performed research with the same dataset origin, that the explanations obtained regarding student dropout match the real-world experiences of mentors and tutors, especially when dealing with highly explanatory features like previous average grades and interventions, and that additional beneficial features would be psychological and emotional well-being information. The results from our proposed methodology were validated directly by practicing mentors and tutors that deal with student dropout on a regular basis. © 2024 CEUR-WS.

This research, therefore, had three significant objectives 1) to develop a model to predict the dropout rate and graduation rate of students in tertiary education, 2) to assess the effectiveness of the prediction model, and 3) to determine the contributing factors that affect the dropout rate and the graduation rate of students in higher education. This research highlighted the students’ academic achievement in the Bachelor of Business Administration Program in Management program at the Faculty of Business Administration and Information Technology at the Rajamangala University of Technology Tawan-ok: Chakrabongse Bhuvanarth Campus, Bangkok, Thailand. The data collected was 547 students in this educational program during the academic year 2015 – 2022. It contains 14,402 transactions. The research tool used educational data mining development and applied machine learning techniques for factor analysis. The research results found that the COVID-19 pandemic had significant implications for the reduced graduation of students in the Business Administration Program in Management programs. It was also found that factors related to 21st-century skills influenced the student’s termination. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group.",Academic achievement model; COVID-19; Dropout analysis; Educational data mining;

This research paper aims to explore the factors contributing to Ph.D. students' decision to dropout and their interrelationships. For this purpose, we employed the hybrid topic modeling Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers – Latent Dirichlet Allocation (BERT-LDA) algorithm and Numerical Association Rule Mining (NARM) using a genetic algorithm in QuantMiner. We identified and analyzed individual, institutional, and social factors that affect Ph.D. students in leaving their current degrees. The results suggest that financial constraints, inadequate academic preparation, poor mentoring, social isolation, lack of social support, family responsibilities, and work-life balance are significant elements responsible for dropout. These findings also reveal that these factors are interrelated, and their effects can be mitigated by the academic institution's policies and culture. The outcomes of the study have implications for academic institutions, policymakers, and researchers, who can use them to develop evidence-based strategies and interventions that enhance Ph.D. students' retention and success. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Dropout; Factors; Machine learning; Numerical association rule mining (NARM); Ph.D; Qualitative content-based analysis,,"Ali A., Gregg Kohun F., Dealing with isolation feelings in is doctoral programs, International Journal of Doctoral Studies, 1, pp. 021-033, (2006); Understanding the factors affecting degree completion of doctoral women in the Science and Engineering Fields, New Directions for Institutional Research, 2011, 152, pp. 59-73, (2011); Predicting Student Dropout in Higher Education., (2016); Austin A.E., Preparing the next generation of faculty: Graduate school as socialization to the academic career, The journal of higher education, 73, 1, pp. 94-122, (2002); Doctoral Student Attrition and Persistence: a Meta-Synthesis of Research, pp. 481-534, (2005); Baker V.L., Lattuca L.R., Developmental networks and learning: Toward an interdisciplinary perspective on identity development during doctoral study, Studies in higher education, 35, 7, pp. 807-827, (2010); Bean J.P., Eaton S.B., A psychological model of college student retention, Reworking the student departure puzzle, 1, pp. 48-61, (2000); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, Journal of machine Learning research, 3, Jan, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Blyth S., Karl Pearson and the correlation curve, International Statistical Review/Revue Internationale De Statistique, pp. 393-403, (1994); Castellanos J., Gloria A.M., Research considerations and theoretical application for best practices in higher education: Latina/os achieving success, Journal of Hispanic Higher Education, 6, 4, pp. 378-396, (2007); Chai X., Tang G., Wang S., Peng R., Chen W., Li J., Deep learning for regularly missing data reconstruction, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 58, 6, pp. 4406-4423, (2020); Multi-dimensional regression analysis of time-series data streams, In VLDB'02: Proceedings of the 28Th International Conference on Very Large Databases, pp. 323-334, (2002); Cyranoski D., Gilbert N., Ledford H., Nayar A., Yahia M., Education: The phd factory, Nature, 472, 7343, pp. 276-279, (2011); Devlin J., Chang M.W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.

School dropout is a culmination of various factors that drive children to leave school, and timely policy responses are most needed to address these underlying factors and improve school retention of children over time. However, applying ML approaches to school dropout prediction is an important challenge, especially in low-income countries, where data collection and management systems are relatively more prone to financial and technical constraints. For this reason, this study suggests using already collected household panel data to predict the probability of school dropout and explore feature importance for primary school children in Malawi through ML models. A rich set of variables is obtained in this study from the household data and used to build Random Forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Ridge and multilayer neural network (MNN) models. The study further explores how performance metrics differ when we embed the training samples' weights representing frequency in sampling design into the cost function of these ML models to discuss the implications of using household data in computational social science. LASSO and MNN models trained with sample weights become more prominent due to their higher recall rates of 80.6% and 78.8%. Compared to the baseline model trained with sample weights, the recall rate gained is roughly 56 percentage points using LASSO and 54 percentage points using MNN. Also, comparing LASSO and MNN trained with and without sample weights reveals that training models with sample weights increase the recall rate roughly by 11 percentage points for LASSO and 12 percentage points for MNN. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive and unified approach to better interpret the models using a game-theoretic approach – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) – to quantify feature importance. As a result, socio-economic characteristics of children, such as working in household farming and father's education level, are among the most important features contributing to the probability of school dropout in ML models. This study argues that the weighted sample structure of household data and its wide range of variables explored through the SHAP method for feature importance can enrich the literature and yield valuable results to harness data science for society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Educational data mining; Feature importance; Machine learning; Sample weights; School dropout prediction,,"Global status and trends.

This paper describes the evaluation of the Mind Tutor app, an artificial intelligence based wellbeing app specifically designed for first year undergraduate students, which included a chatbot function that guided students to relevant wellbeing content. The content of the app was developed based on data about mental health and wellbeing issues reported by students and focussed on anxiety, low mood, academic study, transition to university and relationships. Two randomised controlled evaluation studies were conducted with N = 177 and N = 240 first year undergraduate students from two UK universities (the second due to delays in development work and difficulties with recruitment in the first trial). The Mind Tutor had no significant impact on student wellbeing. The study suffered from poor recruitment and retention rates. However, further research is warranted to understand factors that may increase engagement and acceptability of app based tools to increase student wellbeing. © The Author(s) 2023.","Chatbot, evaluation study; Evaluation Study, First Year Undergraduate Students; Mind Tutor; Student Wellbeing",,"Abd-alrazaq A.A., Alajlani M., Alalwan A.A., Bewick B.M., Gardner P., Househ M., An overview of the features of chatbots in mental health: A scoping review, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 132, (2019); Aguirre Velasco A., Cruz I.S.S., Billings J., Jimenez M., Rowe S., What are the barriers, facilitators and interventions targeting help-seeking behaviours for common mental health problems in adolescents?

In this work, the performance of nine regression algorithms has been evaluated in predicting students' academic success. Information from 650 students enrolled in three different computing majors has been assembled into a dataset. The following input attributes were chosen: attendance rate, course grade, gender, course category, delivery mode, school type, and high school score; the grade point average was the target variable. Findings indicate that Random Forest Regressor, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Extra Tree are the four most effective regression algorithms in the order given. Except for the Light Gradient Boosting Machine approach, the other three algorithms showed that course grade is the most important predictor of a student's GPA, followed by high school score. All four algorithms showed that gender is the least reliable indicator of GPA. Future work will conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of individual attributes on predictions to gain more insight into the factors affecting students' performance.

The present research has a quantitative approach, correlational scope, non-experimental cross-sectional design, non-parametric statistics, working with a sample of 317 university students, and a diagnostic instrument with Cronbach’s α of 83.8%. We worked with the Weka software and the Bayesian classification algorithm J48, obtaining an accuracy level of 76% in predicting academic performance, indicating the influential factors for high academic performance. The results show a weak significant correlation between academic performance and factors. It was concluded that through the use of the artificial intelligence forecast model, the university can identify the influential factors in academic performance, and they can improve it with extracurricular activities and work with the least significant factors through training or psychological well-being workshops to avoid dropout rates and thus have good performance and the development of their capabilities. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",academic performance; Artificial intelligence; classifiers; external factors; forecasting model; internal factors,Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Academic performance; Engineering informatics; Engineering systems; External factors; Forecasting models; Incidence factor; Influential factors; Internal factors; Model-based OPC; Performance forecasting; Forecasting,"Castrillon O., Giraldo J., Ruiz S., Principales factores influyentes en el rendimiento académico: Un caso de estudio, 16th LACCEI International Multi-Conference for Engineering, Education, and Technology: “Innovation in Education and Inclusion, (2018); Castrillon O., Sarache W., Ruiz-Herrera S., Prediction of academic performance using artificial intelligence techniques, Formación Universitaria, 13, 1, pp. 93-102, (2020); Leiva L., Calvo B., Conejo F., Inteligencia Artificial para la transformación digital en la toma de decisiones, Tecnología Vital, 4, 7, (2020); Coronado R., Propuesta de fiscalización automática de la producción de petróleo mediante una unidad de medición mejorada en el Nor Oeste del Perú, (2019); Sidorov G., Métodos Modernos de Inteligencia Artificial, (2011); Ocana Y., Valenzuela L., Garro L., Inteligencia artificial y sus implicaciones en la educación superior, Propósitos y Representaciones, 7, 2, pp. 536-568, (2019); Marino S., Primorac C., Propuesta metodológica para desarrollo de modelos de redes neuronales artificiales supervisadas, IJERI: International Journal of Educational Research and Innovation, 6, pp. 231-245, (2016); Aplicaciones de la Inteligencia Artificial: cómo se utiliza actualmente, (2019); Vasquez C., 5 aplicaciones de la inteligencia artificial que utilizas cada día, (2021); Gonzalez S., Velasquez V., Pronóstico de demanda utilizando inteligencia artificial, (2020); Cardenas P., Herramientas de análisis multivariante predictivo y minería de datos con SPSS Modeler y Statistics: Estudio comparativo, Juan Mejía, Ensayos 2018, Análisis Multivariante con enfoque dependiente en las ciencias de la administración como base para la innovación, pp. 11-40, (2019); Garcia M., Alvarez A., Análisis de Datos en WEKA – Pruebas de Selectividad; Ferreira K., Tipos de Inteligencia Artificial: conoce cuáles existen y cómo usarlos, (2021); Garbanzo G., Factores asociados al rendimiento académico en estudiantes universitarios, una reflexión desde la calidad de la educación superior pública, Revista Educación, 31, 1, pp. 43-63, (2007); Gutierrez J., Garzon J., Segura A., Factores asociados al rendimiento académico en estudiantes universitarios, Formación universitaria, 14, 1, pp. 13-24, (2021); Ekubo E.A., Esiefarienrhe B.M., Using machine learning to predict low academic performance at a Nigerian university, En: Afr. j. inf.

One of the important issues with video-based learning is to devise effective teaching strategies to ensure higher level of learning can be achieved by the students. Getting insight and predicting the students’ video-based learning adoption will help the educators. Thus, this study aims to examine the potential of using machine learning prediction models on video-based learning adoption in higher education institutions. Five machine learning algorithms were used to be empirically compared namely generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), gradient boosted tree (GBT), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of each machine learning algorithm in predicting the students’ learning adoption with video-based learning has been observed based on the attributes of task-technology fit theory. The findings indicated that the task-technology fit is useful in helping the machine learning algorithm to achieve high accuracy in the prediction of video-based learning adoption. The GBT is the best outperforming algorithm, followed with RF and SVM.

To tackle this problem, forecasting student success as early as possible with machine learning is one of the most important approaches used in modern universities. Thus, this study aims to analyze and compare models for the early prediction of student performance with six machine learning based on Thailand’s education curriculum. A large dataset was collected from the admission scores of 5,919 students during 2011-2021 of 10 programs in the Faculty of Science at Ubon Ratchathani University. The methodology was carried out using Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, and Scikit-Learn to build the models for prediction. To obtain a higher result, we needed not only to find high-performance prediction models, but also to tune hyperparameter configurations consisting of 138 possible different patterns to identify the best-tuned model for each classifier. Furthermore, we investigated significantly important predictors affecting student success for 10 programs in our faculty. In the experiments, the process was divided into two parts: First, we evaluated effective models using a confusion matrix with 10-fold cross-validation. The results showed that random forest (RF) had the highest F1-measure of 86.87%. While predictive models using fine-tuned RF of 10 programs claimed accuracy of about 72% to 93%. Second, we computed the importance of each feature with fine-tuned RF classifiers. The result showed that national test scores (e.g., ONET-English, ONET-Math, ONET-Science, ONET-Social studies, ONET-Thai, and PAT2), entry type, and school grade (e.g., art, English, GPA, health, math, science, and technology) are highly influential features for predicting student success. In summary, these results yield many benefits for other relevant educational institutions to enhance student performance, plan class strategies and undertake decision-making processes. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

However, students’ source code primarily serves as the basis for grading. Usually, it is not considered to identify key concepts and skills required to complete the course and understand the student’s learning process. This paper presents a system that automatically analyzes source code and identifies the most relevant concepts for first-semester students to pass a university-level programming course. This system uses different tools to detect errors and vulnerabilities, calculate metrics, and generate 55 code-related features from the students’ source codes. The source code submissions of 1,346 students in two cohorts have been considered. Further, an expert study evaluated which of those features can be assigned to concrete programming concepts and how relevant these concepts are for programming education. Furthermore, we used machine learning methods to analyze the most challenging concepts, where students tend to produce the highest number of errors during their learning process. Our findings indicate that understanding and applying dynamic memory significantly impacts the students’ course success. This study provides empirical evidence of the most important programming concepts in C within the CS1 course. Educators can use these results to optimize teaching materials and increase assistance for challenging and crucial concepts, which might reduce the student dropout rate. Our approach further shows how a code-driven approach can be used to analyze a university-level programming course and get insights into its academic success. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",automatic code analysis; educational data mining; programming education,C (programming language); Codes (symbols); Data mining; Education computing; Engineering education; Grading; Learning systems; Teaching; Automatic code analyse; Automatic codes; Code analysis; Educational data mining; Learning process; Programming concepts; Programming course; Programming education; Source codes; University levels; Students,"Budny D., Lund L., Vipperman J., Patzer J., Four steps to teaching c programming, 32Nd Annual Frontiers in Education, Vol. 2, Pp.

For universities globally, this is a concern linked to student attrition, student satisfaction, and student success. Importantly, low sense of belonging is typically associated with non-traditional learners, and building strategies to solve this challenge is essential for institutions to build equitable learning environments. This study seeks to understand the causal factors that predict when a student will belong using longitudinal data. Using the Australian national student experience survey data (n = 1,159,768 undergraduate and postgraduate students between 2013 and 2019), this study examines the predictors of a sense of belonging testing the accuracy of four machine learning models. The findings indicate overall educational experience, connection to students outside of class, and support to settle were key predictors, with skill development and curriculum supports a lesser predictor of a sense of belonging. Interestingly, identity and individual differences ratings seemed to have less importance than student experience factors. Implications for higher education policy developers and curriculum writers are considered. © 2023 The Author(s).

The most important variables to be analyzed in predicting the potential of third molar eruption are retromolar space and the direction of eruption. The various methods for prediction include linear measures: measurement of the available space, mandibular size and growth, size of the third molar, and third molar angulation. The available software is not suitable for predicting third molar eruption. The purpose of the present work was to develop a clinical tool that can automatically predict eruption of the third molars based on combined linear and angular measurements. In this paper, the development and validation analysis of Panoramic Dental Application (PDApp) software (registered by the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)) is presented, which can automatically predict third molar eruption from panoramic radiographs. This prediction is performed using a machine learning classifier (a support vector machine with Gaussian kernel) trained on a set of 188 cases wherein third molar angulation and the radiological retention coefficient are used as input data. Operating in the daily practice of the School of Dentistry at USC, an accuracy of 97.96% in predicting the potential of third molar eruption is achieved for a set of 539 third molars belonging to 289 patients. The software was also rated as the best imaginable system by the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire. In this study, we developed and analyzed a new, unique software tool with increased diagnostic accuracy that will facilitate and optimize dental care in routine clinical workflow. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; machine learning; oral radiology; panoramic radiography; software; third molar,,"Rantanen A.V., The age of eruption of the third molar teeth, Acta Odontol.

In this study, we used a CSX dataset from the coronary angiography registry of Tehran's Heart Center at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran to develop several machine learning (ML) methods combined with uncertainty quantification of the obtained results. Uncertainty quantification plays a significant role in both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) studies allowing researchers to create trustable clinical detection systems. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, called Binarized Multi-Gate Mixture of Bayesian Experts (MoBE), which is an effective ensemble technique for accurately classifying CSX data. The proposed binarized multi-gate model relies on a double quantified uncertainty strategy at the feature selection and decision making stages. First, we use a clinician-in-the-loop scenario with a belief-uncertainty paradigm at the feature selection stage. Second, we use Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as experts in MoBE and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout for gates at the decision making uncertainty quantification stage. The proposed binarized multi-gate model reaches an accuracy of 85% when applied to our benchmark CSX dataset from Tehran's Heart Center. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian neural networks (BNNs); Cardiac syndrome X (CSX); Cardiovascular disease (CVD); Deep learning; Mixture of experts (moE); Uncertainty Quantification (UQ),Anisotropy; Bayesian networks; Cardiology; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diseases; Feature extraction; Heart; Learning systems; Neural networks; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian neural network; Bayesian neural networks; Cardiac syndrome X; Cardiovascular disease; Deep learning; Mixture of expert; Mixture of experts; Uncertainty quantification; Uncertainty quantifications; Decision making,"Du H., Li L., Bennett D., Guo Y., Key T.J., Bian Z., Sherliker P., Gao H., Chen Y., Yang L., Et al., Fresh fruit consumption and major cardiovascular disease in China, N.

To resolve this, various attempts have been made to predict student dropout using machine learning. This paper presents a model to predict student dropout at Sahmyook University using machine learning. Academic records collected from 20,050 students of the university were analyzed and used for learning. Various machine learning algorithms were used to implement the model, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Deep Neural Network, and LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), and their performances were compared through experiments. We also discuss the influence of oversampling used to resolve data imbalance issues in the dropout data. For this purpose, various oversampling algorithms such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and Borderline-SMOTE were tested. Our experimental results showed that the proposed model implemented using LightGBM provided the best performance with an F1-score of 0.840, which is higher than the results of previous studies discussing the dropout prediction with the issue of class imbalance. © 2023 by the authors.",class imbalance; dropout prediction; LightGBM; machine learning; oversampling,,"Kim D., Kim S., Sustainable education: Analyzing the determinants of university student dropout by nonlinear panel data models, Sustainability, 10, (2018); Martinho V.R.D.C., Nunes C., Minussi C.R., An intelligent system for prediction of school dropout risk group in higher education classroom based on artificial neural networks, Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE 25th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 159-166; Jain P., Chhabra H., Chauhan U., Prakash K., Gupta A., Soliman M.S., Islam M.S., Islam M.T., Machine learning assisted hepta band THz metamaterial absorber for biomedical applications, Sci.

Shocks, environmental changes and physical distancing in recent years have led to the implementation of efficient solutions in educational services, based on artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, in the global academic landscape, many international universities have adopted a ‘chatbot’, a digital interface designed to stimulate conversation with people. Modern algorithmic communications have effects, such as: increasing the number of enrollments in public administration programs, improving academic experience and active student participation, while reducing administrative tasks on university staff. This paper aims to provide a glimpse on the perceptions of the potential impact of conversational artificial intelligence on public administration (PA) programs from universities and to reflect on its implications for university leaders and staff work and also on students’ engagement. The paper will focus on how AI tools will help university programs to be more effective, and how technology will support the limited human resources in this sector. In order to gather the data for this research, the interview was used as well as case studies from international universities that have implemented a chatbot. The research findings capture technological and digital advances that will continue to shape the higher education landscape and its curricula, especially in PA programs. As a result, leaders will need to monitor how artificial intelligence, in particular conversational agents, influences universities’ images; attraction and retention for students in PA programs and other important partners; staff productivity, and how to be more proactive in initiating pilot projects. This is one of the few publications that looks at the expectations for conversational AI in higher education today. In this sense, implementing a chatbot can be a competitive advantage in a market where modern technologies weigh heavily and make a difference. © 2023, Babes-Bolyai University.

A systematic review methodology was employed comprised of review protocol, requirements for study selection, and analysis of paper classification. The review aims to answer the following research questions: (1) what techniques are currently used to predict student retention rates, (2) which techniques have shown better performance under specific contexts?, (3) which factors influence the prediction of completion rates in higher education?, and (4) what are the challenges with predicting student retention? Increasing student retention in higher education is critical in order to increase graduation rates. Further, predicting student retention provides insight into opportunities for intentional student advising. The review provides a research perspective related to predicting student retention using machine learning through several key findings such as the identification of the factors utilized in past studies and methodologies used for prediction. These findings can be used to develop more comprehensive studies to further increase the prediction capability and; therefore, develop strategies to improve student retention. © The Author(s) 2020.",data mining; education; machine learning; retention,,"Adejo O.W., Connolly T., Predicting student academic performance using multi-model heterogeneous ensemble approach, Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 61-75, (2018); Alkhasawneh R., Hargraves R.H., Developing a hybrid model to predict student first year retention in STEM disciplines using machine learning techniques, Journal of STEM Education: Innovations and Research, 15, 3, pp. 35-42, (2014); Babic I.D., Machine learning methods in predicting the student academic motivation, Croatian Operational Research Review, 8, pp. 443-461, (2017); Cano A., Zafra A., Ventura S., An interpretable classification rule mining algorithm, Information Sciences, 240, pp. 1-20, (2013); Cardona T., Cudney E., (2019); Cardona T., Cudney E., Snyder J., (2019); Cardona T., Cudney E., Snyder J., (2019); Carnevale A.P., Jayasundera T., Gulish A., (2016); Chen X., (2013); Delen D., A comparative analysis of machine learning techniques for student retention management, Decision Support Systems, 49, 4, pp. 498-506, (2010); Delen D., Predicting student attrition with data mining methods, Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice, 13, 1, pp. 17-35, (2011); Dimeo J., Georgia state improves student outcomes with data, (2017); Dissanayake H., Robinson D., Al-Azzam O., (2016); Essa A., Ayad H., Improving student success using predictive models and data visualisations, Research in Learning Technology, 20, sup1, (2012); Hoffman E., Starobin S., Laanan F.S., Rivera M., Role of community colleges in STEM education: Thoughts on implications for policy, practice, and future research, Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering, 16, 1, pp. 85-96, (2010); Iam-On N., Boongoen T., Improved student dropout prediction in thai university using ensemble of mixed-type data clusterings, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 8, 2, pp. 497-510, (2017); Kirp D., The college dropout scandal.

Traditional advising often focuses on course enrollment, neglecting broader student needs. This study evaluates advising effectiveness by examining advisor-counsel relationships, identifying dropout touch-points, and implementing proactive re-enrollment strategies. To overcome shortcomings in virtual advising, a data-driven approach, employing machine learning algorithms (ML), is proposed. Decision trees, artificial neural networks, and random forests are assessed using a unique dataset to preemptively identify students requiring intensive advising. Results indicate the random forest model's superior performance with a 97.30% accuracy, emphasizing its accuracy in predicting students' counseling needs. © 2024 IEEE.",Academic Advising; Artificial Neural Network; Higher Education; Machine Learning; Predictive Analytics; Random Forest; Student Success,Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Machine learning; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Academic advising; Data-driven approach; Data-mining techniques; High educations; Machine-learning; Random forests; Student guidance; Student retention; Student success; Touch-points; Students,"Guti F., Seipp K., Ochoa X., Chiluiza K., De Laet T., Verbert K., LADA: A Learning Analytics Dashboard for Academic Advising, Computers in Human Behavior, 107, (2020); Hegazy M., Waguih H., A Proposed Academic Advisor Model based on Data Mining Classification Techniques, International Journal of Advanced Computer Research, 8, 36, pp. 129-136, (2018); Nagy H., Aly W., Hegazy O., An Educational Data Mining System for Advising Higher Education Students, International Journal of Computer and Information Engineering, 7, 10, pp. 1266-1270, (2013); Folsom P., Yoder F., Joslin J.E., The New Advisor Guidebook: Mastering the Art of Academic Advising, (2015); Kuhn T.L., Historical Foundations of Academic Advising, (2008); McFarlane R., Wallder S.R., Engaging Students for Success during a Pandemic: The Impact of Academic Advisement upon Course of Study Completion Rates amongst Business & Computer Studies and Industrial Technology Students at the University of Technology, Jamaica, Voices in Education, 7, pp. 15-24, (2021); Oertel B., Creating the Case for a New Academic Advising Model at Winona State University: A Review of the Literature, (2007); Crookston B.B., A Developmental View of Academic Advising As Teaching, Nacada Journal, 14, 2, pp. 5-9, (1994); Wilder M.B., A Qualitative Case Study on Intrusive Academic Advising, Northcentral University, (2016); Drake J.K., The Role of Academic Advising in Student Retention and Persistence, About Campus: Enriching the Student Learning Experience, 16, 3, pp. 8-12, (2011); Gudep V.K., Issues and Challenges in Academic Advising: A Multivariate Study of Students' Attitudes Towards Academic Advising in United Arab Emirates (UAE, Contemporary Management Research, 3, 2, (2007); Richard M.M., Legal Foundations of Academic Advising, Academic Advising: A Comprehensive Handbook, (2008); Arguello G., Virtual Academic Advising in Challenging Times, The Impact of COVID19 on the International Education System, pp. 184-196, (2020); Arhin V., Wang'eri T., Kigen E., Academic Advising and Student Retention in Distance Learning: The Case of University of Cape Coast, Ghana, Journal of Educational and Social Research, 7, 3, (2017); Meneth N., Cracks to Craters: College Advising during COVID-19, Aera Open, 7, (2021); Gokhan A., Oktay Guzeller C., Eser M.T., The Effect of the Normalization Method Used in Different Sample Sizes on the Success of Artificial Neural Network Model, International Journal of Assessment Tools in Education, 6, 2, pp. 170-192, (2019); James G., Witten D., Hastie T., Tibshirani R., An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, 112, (2013); Sharda R., Delen D., Turban E., Analytics Data Science & Artificial Intelligence: Systems for Decision Support, (2021); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Karamitsos I., Murad O., Modak S., Service Analytics on ITSM Processes Using Time Series, Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Computing, pp. 45-56, (2022); Kanavos A., Iakovou S.A., Sioutas S., Tampakas V., Large Scale Product Recommendation of Supermarket Ware Based on Customer Behaviour Analysis, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 2, (2018); Vonitsanos G., Kanavos A., Mylonas P., Sioutas S., A NoSQL Database Approach for Modeling Heterogeneous and Semi-Structured Information, 9th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications IISA, pp. 1-8, (2018); Kanavos A., Karamitsos I., Mohasseb A., Gerogiannis V., A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms and Text Vectorization Methods for Fake News Detection, 14th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA, (2023); Karamitsos I., Papadaki M., Themistocleous M., Ncube C., Blockchain as a Service (BCaaS): A Value Modeling Approach in the Education Business Model, Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 5, pp. 165-182, (2022); Sioutas S., Mylonas P., Panaretos A., Gerolymatos P., Vogiatzis D., Karavaras E., Spitieris T., Kanavos A., Survey of Machine Learning Algorithms on Spark over DHT-based Structures, 2nd International Workshop on Algorithmic Aspects of Cloud Computing (ALGOCLOUD, pp. 146-156, (2016)","R.

The challenge is how to retain students who do not meet requirements during their first year and are at high risk of dropping out, which can have significant economic and social consequences as well as personal ramifications for the students themselves. Universities must prioritize identifying at-risk students and providing targeted assistance to prevent them from leaving the system. Machine learning (ML) models have proven effective in identifying students at risk of dropping out with a high degree of accuracy. In this study, we aim to construct a machine learning model using data extracted from the administration system (Neptun) to predict student dropout rates in the Business Informatics BSc course at the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of Budapest Business School. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

One of the biggest challenges to predicting student performance is presented in the course 'Programming Fundamentals' of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems Engineering careers in Peruvian universities for high student dropout rates. The objective of this research was to explore the efficiency of Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) to predict the academic performance of students during the seventh, eighth, twelfth, and sixteenth weeks of the academic semester, which allowed us to identify students at risk of failing the course. This research compares several predictive models, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A major challenge machine learning algorithms face is a class imbalance in a dataset, resulting in over-fitting to the available data and, consequently, low accuracy. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data needed in our proposal. From the experimental results based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, the superiority of our model is verified concerning a better classification, with 98.3% accuracy in week 8 using LSTM-GAN, followed by DNN-GAN with 98.1% accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE.",Educational data mining; generative adversarial networks; long-short term memory; synthetic minority over-sampling technique,Brain; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Generative adversarial networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Nearest neighbor search; Professional aspects; Software engineering; Support vector machines; Value engineering; Academic performance; Classification algorithm; Educational data mining; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Programming fundamentals; Radiofrequencies; Static VAr compensator; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Students,"Delgado F.A., Martel A.I., Ii Informe Bienal Sobre la Realidad Universitaria en El Perú, (2020); Computing curricula 2020: Paradigms for global computing education, Acm Ieee, (2020); Nieto-Chaupis H., Alfaro-Acuna A., The management of a private Peruvian university at pandemic times: Assessment of decisions and implications on the key indicators, Proc. 14th Int.

Throughout the development, socioeconomic variables with the highest impact on characterized academic dropout processes to create a dataset. This dataset was then utilized with various artificial intelligence techniques explored in Machine Learning (Decision Trees, K-means, and Regression), ultimately determining the most effective algorithm for integration into the Software. The decision tree classification technique emerged as the most effective, achieving an impressive accuracy of 91% and a minimal error rate of 9%, substantiating its state-of-the-art standing. As a result, this Software has optimized processes within the Student Welfare Department at SENA and is adaptable for use in any higher education institution.

The Austrian academic system relies on “student activity” for university funding, defined as accumulating 16+ ECTS credits per study year. This study proposes a combined method of machine learning and ARIMA models, predicting the number of studies eligible for funding in the next study year. Data from the University of Graz between 2013/14 and 2020/21 was used for machine learning, and data from 2011/12 to 2020/21 was used as a base for the ARIMA models. Repeated predictions for the outcome years 2018/19 to 2021/22 yielded values of accuracy at.82, precision at.76, and recall at.73. The results showed deviations between <1% and 7% from the official values. Differences may be explained by the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study offers a new approach to gaining information about future successful students, which is valuable for the implementation of preventive support structures. © The Author(s) 2023.",ARIMA model; dropout; machine learning; student activity; student retention,,"Alban M., Mauricio D., Predicting university dropout through data mining: A systematic literature, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 12, 4, pp. 1-12, (2019); Albreiki B., Zaki N., Alashwal H., A systematic literature review of student’s performance prediction using machine learning techniques, Education Sciences, 11, 9, (2021); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., (2017); Barbera S.A., Berkshire S.D., Boronat C.B., Kennedy M.H., Review of undergraduate student retention and graduation since 2010: Patterns, predictions, and recommendations for 2020, Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory & Practice, 22, 2, pp. 227-250, (2020); Bardach L., Luftenegger M., Oczlon S., Spiel C., Schober B., Context-related problems and university students’ dropout intentions—The buffering effect of personal best goals, European Journal of Psychology of Education, 35, pp. 477-493, (2020); Behr A., Theune K., The causal effect of off-campus work on time to degree, Education Economics, 24, 2, pp. 189-209, (2016); Bell D.N., Blanchflower D.G., US and UK labour markets before and during the COVID-19 crash, National Institute Economic Review, 252, pp. R52-R69, (2020); Box G.E., Jenkins G.M., Time series analysis: Forecasting and control, (1970); Bulman G., Fairlie R., The impact of COVID-19 on community college enrollment and student success: Evidence from California administrative data, Education Finance and Policy, 17, 4, pp. 745-764, (2022); Chaudhury P., Mishra S., Tripathy H.K., Kishore B., (2016); Chen C.K., An integrated enrollment forecast model, IR Applications, 15, pp. 1-18, (2008); Chen X.W., Jeong J.C., (2007); Chen Y.A., Li R., Hagedorn L.S., Undergraduate international student enrollment forecasting model: An application of time series analysis, Journal of International Students, 9, 1, pp. 242-261, (2019); Deane-Mayer Z.A., Knowles J.E., (2019); Dewan M.A., Lin F., Wen D., (2015); Dietterich T., Overfitting and undercomputing in machine learning, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 27, 3, pp. 326-327, (1995); European Credit Transfer System: ECTS Users’ Guide 2015, (2015); Ewell S.N., Josefson C.C., Ballen C.J., Why did students report lower test anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic?, Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education, 23, 1, pp. e00282-e221, (2022); (2002); (2018); Development Plan of Austrian Universities 2022–2027, (2019); (2023); Development Plan of Austrian Universities 2025–2030; Forsythe E., Kahn L., Lange F., Wiczer D., Labor demand in the time of COVID-19: Evidence from vacancy postings and UI claims, Journal of Public Economics, 189, 2020, (2020); Gevrey M., Dimopoulos I., Lek S., Review and comparison of methods to study the contribution of variables in artificial neural network models, Ecological Modelling, 160, 3, (2003); Hastie T., Qian J., Tay K., (2021); Heublein U., Student drop-out from German higher education institutions, European Journal of Education, 49, 4, pp. 497-513, (2014); Huang S., Fang N., Predicting student academic performance in an engineering dynamics course: A comparison of four types of predictive mathematical models, Computers & Education, 61, 2013, pp. 133-145, (2013); (2020); Iyengar V.S., Apte C., Zhang T., (2000); Kabathova J., Drlik M., Towards predicting student’s dropout in university courses using different machine learning techniques, Applied Sciences, 11, 7, (2021); Karran T., Achieving Bologna convergence: Is ECTS failing to make the grade?, Higher Education in Europe, 29, 3, pp. 411-421, (2004); Kotsiantis S.B., Zaharakis I., Pintelas P., Supervised machine learning: A review of classification technique, Emerging Artificial Intelligence Applications in Computer Engineering, 160, 1, pp. 3-24, (2007); Kuhn M., Building predictive models in R using the caret package, Journal of Statistical Software, 28, 5, pp. 1-26, (2008); Layzell D.T., The future is now: Limitations of the crystal ball and other lessons learned, New Directions for Institutional Research, 93, pp. 95-99, (1997); Linden K., Improving student retention by providing targeted support to university students who do not submit an early assessment item.

Dropout prediction is related to student retention and has been studied extensively in recent work; however, there is little literature on predicting academic success using educational machine learning. For this reason, CRISP-DM methodology was applied to extract relevant knowledge and features from the data. The dataset examined consists of 6690 records and 21 variables with academic and socioeconomic information. Preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms were analyzed. The area under the curve was used to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm; XGBoost had an AUC = 87.75% and correctly classified eight out of ten cases, while the decision tree improved interpretation with ten rules in seven out of ten cases. Recognizing the gaps in the study and that on-time completion of college consolidates college self-efficacy, creating intervention and support strategies to retain students is a priority for decision makers. Assessing the fairness and discrimination of the algorithms was the main limitation of this work. In the future, we intend to apply the extracted knowledge and learn about its influence of on university management. © 2024 by the authors.",academic success; educational analysis; educational data mining; higher education; machine learning,Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Students; Academic performance; Academic success; College students; Educational analyse; Educational data mining; High educations; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Prior experience; Self efficacy; Machine learning,"Realinho V., Machado J., Baptista L., Martins M.V., Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success, Data, 7, (2022); Ortiz-Lozano J.M., Rua-Vieites A., Bilbao-Calabuig P., Casadesus-Fa M., University student retention: Best time and data to identify undergraduate students at risk of dropout, Innov.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is one of these methods and represents a contemporary technique based on neural network fundamentals to solve differential equations. These networks can potentially improve or complement classical numerical methods in computational physics, making them an exciting area of study. In this paper, we introduce PINNs at an elementary level, mainly oriented to physics education, making them suitable for educational purposes at both undergraduate and graduate levels. PINNs can be used to create virtual simulations and educational tools that aid in understating complex physical concepts and processes involving differential equations. By combining the power of neural networks with physics principles, PINNs can provide an interactive and engaging learning experience that can improve students’ understanding and retention of physics concepts in higher education. © 2023 European Physical Society.",artificial intelligence; differential equations; neural networks; physics,Deep learning; Numerical methods; Artificial intelligence methods; Computational physics; Contemporary techniques; Elementary levels; Graduate-level; Neural-networks; Physics education; Physics-making; Scientific community; Virtual simulation tools; Differential equations,"Carleo G, Cirac I, Cranmer K, Daudet L, Schuld M, Tishby N, Vogt-Maranto L, Zdeborova L, Machine learning and the physical sciences, Rev.

This is crucial for fulfilling their social role, delivering high-quality professionals to society, contributing to economic development, and preventing the resource wastage. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools capable of predicting dropout rates and identifying undergraduates at risk. This study aims to investigate and discuss the state-of-the-art in applying AI algorithms to address students’ dropout. To achieve this objective, a systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted, encompassing 223 studies at first. Finally, 23 studies were selected for in-depth analysis to explore the effectiveness of AI algorithms in predicting students’ dropout. Furthermore, we identified key methodological design issues associated with the application of these AI algorithms, including common features and challenges in implementing these methodologies. This study contributes by providing practitioners and researchers with an overview of the main challenges faced by AI algorithms in predicting students’ dropout, highlighting issues related to modeling, experimental methodology, and problem framing. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",Algorithm; Artificial Intelligence; College; Dropout; Machine Learning; Students; Systematic Mapping Study; University,,"Agrusti F., Mezzini M., Bonavolonta G., Deep learning approach for predicting university dropout: A case study at roma tre university, Journal of e-learning and knowledge society, 16, 1, pp. 44-54, (2020); Anh B.

The key contribution of this study is to apply the uplift modeling framework to optimize preparatory course assignments as an instrument to boost student success for graduation. Specifically, we concentrate on two university programs, English and Math preparatory courses, to identify students who would benefit the most from these courses and successfully graduate. To achieve this objective, we analyze 10-years of incoming freshmen data with a wide range of feature variables from a major university in the US. We then build and test several uplift methodologies to determine students’ response to the treatments. The best-performing model allows us to identify students in different segments and target those who are most responsive to the treatment to achieve optimal results. Additionally, we identify the most significant variables and provide student profiles and attributes that distinguish those who would gain from preparatory courses from those who would not. The framework developed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for decision-making and policy support. It can improve not only the student success perspective, but also the allocation of university resources by identifying and advising a fraction of students who would benefit from taking these preparatory courses and have a positive impact on their graduation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Graduation success;

Different literatures have considered individual factors of behavioral and cognitive aspects to assess student loyalty. However, limited studies have tried to holistically cover student's loyalty for retention in the same institute throughout the years. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to investigate factors affecting students' loyalty to continue higher education in the same university. Specifically, factors under the self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior was applied in this study, extended with other factors such as student satisfaction and university image to completely assess the intention towards loyalty among high school students. This study utilized a machine learning algorithm, random forest classifier due to its capability to have high accuracy rate in predicting factors affecting human behavior. It was deduced that highly significant factors such as autonomy and affective behavior would lead to very high loyalty among students. On the other hand, perceived behavioral control and university image are significant which would lead to a high loyalty behavior among students. With 92% accuracy rate, it could be suggested that the integration and extension of SDT and TPB provided holistic measurement of the behavioral and cognitive aspects of students for institute retention and option. Moreover, it is suggested that tools such as structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithm be integrated to have highly holistic measurement of significant factors affecting human behavior in different field. © 2023 ACM.",random forest classifier; self-determination theory; student loyalty; theory of planned behavior,Behavioral research; Education computing; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Accuracy rate; Behavioural aspects; Cognitive aspects; High educations; Human behaviors; Machine learning algorithms; Random forest classifier; Self-determination theories; Student loyalty; Theory of Planned Behavior; Students,"Jones M.A., Reynolds K.E., Arnold M.J., Hedonic and utilitarian shopping value: Investigating differential effects on retail outcomes, Journal of Business Research, 59, 9, pp. 974-981, (2006); Mesta H.A., The impact of satisfaction on loyalty in Higher Education : the mediating role of Universitys Brand Image, Proceedings of the 2nd Padang International Conference on Education, Economics, Business and Accounting (PICEEBA-2, 2019, (2018); Chen Y.-C., The impact of marketing strategies and satisfaction on student loyalty: A structural equation model approach, International Education Studies, 9, 8, (2016); Dona Toledo L., Luque Martinez T., How loyal can a graduate ever be?

This is especially true in the field of computing in which skills shortages in the labour market are high but so too are student dropout rates. Loss of interest in the computing field has been reported among the reasons for students dropping out. The aim of this study is to offer a fresh perspective of the factors influencing undergraduate student's interest and choice of specialisation in computing. Previous studies have mainly focused on five ACM-identified computing disciplines: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. With the ever-growing nature of computing, two more disciplines recently emerged: Cybersecurity and Data Science. HEIs continuously endeavour to expand computing programmes into specialist areas within these disciplines such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, robotics and creative computing. For prospective students, this maze of options can make for a difficult decision. 137 first-year computing students were invited to participate in a mixed-methods survey to explore their choices around cybersecurity and other newer specialisations. The results of the survey were matched with findings from recent literature, and show that personal interest, family, media, career prospects and prior experiences still influence student choices, with media appearing to have a greater impact compared to earlier studies. HEIs can use this when developing effective recruitment strategies in computing.  © 2022 ACM.",computing; computing education; disciplines; specialisations; student choices,Artificial intelligence; Employment; Engineering education; Software engineering; Surveys; Computing; Computing disciplines; Computing education; Cyber security; Discipline; High educations; Higher education institutions; Specialisation; Student choice; Student studies; Students,"Ndidiamaka Abe E., Chikoko V., 2020.

It aims to provide a set of aspect terms and sentiments from a piece of text. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is now an essential tool for analysing pedagogical data. In academic institutions, student feedback is an influential gauge to measure the quality of the teaching–learning process. It helps higher education institutions to reconsider and improve their policies for student recruitment and retention. This paper proposed a situation awareness multi-layer topic modelling and enhanced hybrid machine learning approach for evaluating students’ textual feedback data in academic institutions. The proposed Aspect2Labels (A2L) approach is divided our system into three layers. To preserve semantic information, we extracted general aspects terms in the first layer known as high-level aspects. We pulled low-level aspects terms associated with high-level aspect terms in the second layer and the third layer used for sentiment orientation. We used zero-shot learning, LDA, and different variants of LDA for the aspect extraction process. We performed annotation on unlabelled students’ comments using our proposed A2L approach, and we obtained 91.3% accuracy in this process. We developed and tested novel algorithms for aspect terms mapping to label each aspect term to corresponding feedback. Different machine learning algorithms have been used to classify sentiments according to extracted aspects. We have also proposed and used Variable Global Feature Selection Scheme (VGFSS) and Variable Stopwords Filtering (VSF) to improve the performance of classifiers. We have managed to get 97% and 93% accuracy on the test dataset using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), respectively. We highly suggest that our novel approach of aspect-oriented sentiment analysis could provide adequate understanding to analyse students’ feedback. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Aspect extraction; Aspect-based sentiment analysis;

One possible framework to investigate students' persistence is Situated Expectancy Value Theory (SEVT), which proposes that students' achievement-related choices and performance are influenced by expectation of success, and subjective task value. In this contribution, we combined SEVT with data science tools to better understand students' academic decision-making, specifically the decision to persist in engineering. Our goal was to identify underlying patterns that predict persistence as well as illuminate possible interventions. Here, three machine learning tools, namely, clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and decision trees, were applied to data from two cohorts of engineering students at a large public university. Concerning the SEVT framework, student responses to surveys given at the beginning and end of the first semester, containing established scales for self-efficacy and contingencies of academic competence self-worth (expectancies), and interest in engineering and perceived costs of studying engineering (subjective task values) were used. Demographic data including race, gender, and Pell eligibility, alongside performance data in the form of introductory course grades, GPA, and persistence into Year 2, complete the set of gathered information available to our data analyses. Collectively, we were interested in learning patterns that allowed us to use academic performance and SEVT data to predict engineering retention. Supporting previous findings in the literature, results from clustering analyses and a PCA indicate that performance in the first-semester engineering courses is highly predictive of persistence in engineering. Potential interventions include mid-first-semester feedback and learning interventions, as well as study habits and time management. New findings indicate that the SEVT framework also significantly predicts persistence, especially for mid-level performers. Discussions in the second semester with students are proposed for both research purposes as well as an intervention to improve student persistence. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,Cost engineering; Decision trees; Engineering education; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Engineering persistence; Expectancy-value theory; Individual interests; Machine learning techniques; Performance; Principal-component analysis; Science tools; Student achievement; Student persistences; Uncertainty; Students,"Board N.

This problem has a global character, so it is common to identify it in different parts of the world. However, there are few solutions that efficiently take advantage of available technology and information. Therefore, this study implements a predictive analysis model to identify students at risk of dropout in Peruvian universities and the variables that influence it. For this purpose, the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP - DM) methodology is used to develop the model and four Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology consists of five phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The experiment was carried out by conducting a survey to 385 students from different public and private universities in Peru, where cognitive, affective, family environment, pre-university, career and university variables were considered. The results showed that the most influential variables in the prediction of university dropout were 'age', 'term' and the student's 'financing method'. We also found that the Random Forest algorithm obtained the best performance, with an AUC of 0.9623 in the prediction of college dropout.  © 2023 FRUCT.",,Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Analysis models; Business understanding; Cross industry; Five-phase; High educations; Industry standards; Machine learning algorithms; Neural network and support vector machines; Random forests; Standards process; Students,"Minedu: Tasa de deserción en educación universitaria se redujo a 11.5 %, (2021); Gray C.C., Perkins D., Utilizing early engagement and machine learning to predict student outcomes, Comput.

Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models – such as the CatBoost classifier – can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful. © 2023, The Author(s).",Dropout prediction; Educational data science;

We aimed to create a web platform using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) architecture to predict students' performance, analyze mental fatigue, and provide real-time quantitative biofeedback to identify the best learning modality. Thus, the main goal was to develop a system that allows students to learn and improve their projects. We integrated the analysis of real-time biometric signals, machine learning algorithms, and web services as we observed their behavior under different learning modalities, seeking to improve cognitive performance. For this, 23 volunteers filled out the ten-question Fatigue Assessment Scale questionnaire about mental fatigue, validated with the P300 waves acquired during auditory-oddball (AO) tests. Synchronized data acquisition was achieved using Enophones and an E4 wristband. To develop predictive models, we collected the biometric data and incorporated it into an ML algorithm to visualize students' performance in real time. The system can accommodate other wearable systems with new features in further experiments. Thus, we believe this current development has the potential to further revolutionize traditional teaching with this methodology and future enhancements.  © 2021 IEEE.",cognitive Performance; education; educational innovation; EEG; higher education; machine learning; neuro-engineering,Biofeedback; Biometrics; Data acquisition; Diseases; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Students; Wearable technology; Web services; Assistance system; Cognitive performance; Educational Applications; Educational innovations; High educations; Learning modalities; Machine learning algorithms; Mental fatigue; Neuroengineering; Real- time; Internet of things,"Ramirez-Moreno M., Et al., EEG-Based Tool for Prediction of University Students' Cognitive Performance in the Classroom, Brain Sciences, 11, 6, (2021); Mishra L., Gupta T., Shree A., Online teaching-learning in higher education during lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic, International Journal of Educational Research Open, 1, (2020); Sun J., Yeh K., The effects of attention monitoring with EEG biofeedback on university students' attention and self-efficacy: The case of anti-phishing instructional materials, Computers & Education, 106, pp. 73-82, (2017); Wass R., Timmermans J., Harland T., McLean A., Annoyance and frustration: Emotional responses to being assessed in higher education, Active Learning in Higher Education, 21, 3, pp. 189-201, (2018); Kim P., Ambient intelligence in a smart classroom for assessing students' engagement levels, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 10, pp. 3847-3852, (2018); Hernandez-De-Menendez M., Morales-Menendez R., Escobar C., Arinez J., Biometric applications in education, International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM, 15, 2-3, pp. 365-380, (2021); Ramirez-Moreno M., Et al., Evaluation of a Fast Test Based on Biometric Signals to Assess Mental Fatigue at the Workplace-A Pilot Study, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 22, (2021); Ramirez-Moreno M., Et al., EEG signals of University Level Students Learning using Video and Text, Ieee DataPort, (2021); Ramirez-Moreno M., Et al., Advanced Learning Assistant System (ALAS) for Engineering Education, 2020 Ieee Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON, (2020); Betts A.S., Ferris J., Fincham J., Neural imaging to track mental states while using an intelligent tutoring system, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107, 15, pp. 7018-7023, (2010); Pourmohammadi S., Maleki A., Stress detection using ECG and EMG signals: A comprehensive study, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 193, (2020); Ramirez-Moreno M., Et al., Advanced Learning Assistant System (ALAS) for Engineering Education, 2020 Ieee Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON, (2020); Picton T., The P300 Wave of the Human Event-Related Potential, Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology, 9, 4, pp. 456-479, (1992); Eno: Noise-cancelling Headphones to Improve Focus, (2021); Empatica E4, (2021); Pires F., Et al., Mental Fatigue Alters Cortical Activation and Psychological Responses, Impairing Performance in a Distance-Based Cycling Trial, Frontiers in Physiology, 9, (2018); Jeong J., Yu B., Lee D., Lee S., Classification of Drowsiness Levels Based on a Deep Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Bidirectional LSTM Network Using Electroencephalography Signals, Brain Sciences, 9, 12, (2019); Wilcox G., Morett L., Hawes Z., Dommett E., Why Educational Neuroscience Needs Educational and School Psychology to Effectively Translate Neuroscience to Educational Practice, Frontiers in Psychology, 11, (2021); Bevilacqua D., Et al., Brain-to-Brain Synchrony and Learning Outcomes Vary by Student-Teacher Dynamics: Evidence from a Realworld Classroom Electroencephalography Study, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 31, 3, pp. 401-411, (2019)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128391956,,

To address this problem, the reasons behind this phenomenon need to be explored. However, most educational data sets have small sample sizes and varying patterns. Currently, there are few machine learning approaches for Pakistani higher education student performance. This study presents a machine learning-based approach to predict student withdrawals and identify the reasons behind them. The proposed approach compares two supervised ML algorithms, K-N earestNeighbors (KNN) and Decision-Tree (DT).

It includes the money contribution of tax-payers and also a proportion of graduates and higher degree holders. Moreover, it becomes furthermore significant to realize and identify the leading causes of this dropout rate. This research article focuses on evaluating the causations for the student dropout and also endeavors to measure the relationships among these factors. It purely gravitates towards the development of a thought process that clarifies the rationalizations and underpinnings for the student dropout from universities and colleges. The research approach initiates at setting a hypothesis by consolidating the several considered factors that affect the dropout rate. After the stratification of influencing factors (sociodemographic, family background, emotional motivation, etc.), we performed statistical analysis using PSPP statistical tool. The data for the experimentation were mustered up from 328 university students, majorly belonging to the streams of science, engineering, and commerce. Furthermore, the collected data were processed as per the tool format, and frequency and descriptive analysis were accomplished to calculate the quality of the collected data. A chi-square test was employed to find the relationship between the considered factors and the dropout rate. The assumed hypothesis was verified, and the results reveal the list of factors that directly impacts the student dropout rate. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Chi-square; Education; PSPP; Statistical method; Student dropout,Data streams; Machine learning; Quality control; Statistical mechanics; Statistical tests; Taxation; Chi-square tests; Descriptive analysis; Education systems; Research approach; Statistical tools; Thought process; Universities and colleges; University students; Students,"Raju D., Exploring student characteristics of retention that lead to graduation in higher education using data mining models, J Coll Stud Retent Res Theory Pract, 16, 4, pp. 563-591, (2015); Marquez-Vera C., Cano A., Romero C., Noaman A.Y.M., Mousa Fardoun H., Ventura S., Early dropout prediction using data mining: A case study with high school students, Expert Syst, 33, 1, pp. 107-124, (2016); Ullah M.A., Alam M.M., Mahiuddin M., Rahman M.M., Predicting Factors of Students Dissatisfaction for Retention.

The findings highlight the student performance based on their demographic status and use of university resources such as financial aid. College campuses should not only increase current resources but also raise awareness of current resources and make them more accessible (e.g., easier to apply or automatic applications). This is especially important for some demographics such as Hispanic first-generation students. Background: Higher education institutions are facing retention and graduation problems. One way to improve this is by understanding why students are not academically successful. Research Questions: In this study, demographic information and past academic records were analyzed to understand patterns of student success. Methodology: A cluster analysis was conducted to understand groups of students based on academic performance and demographic information. Examples of these factors are enrollment status, financial status, first-generation status, housing status, and transfer status. For the purpose of getting more accurate results, the students were separated into two different groups according to their admission status: 1) freshman and 2) transfer. Findings: The results indicate Hispanic, first-generation, low-income students are not likely to apply for financial aid although they are eligible. They have lower GPA and take fewer units per semester than other students. This can cause delayed graduation and accumulating more debt. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Clustering methods; data mining; engineering education; machine learning; student success,Cluster analysis; Finance; Population statistics; Academic performance; Automatic application; Demographic information; Grade point average; Higher education institutions; Research questions; Student performance; University resources; Students,"Cook B., Hartle T., First in the World by 2020: What Will It Take, pp. 1-5, (2011); Cherif A., Adams G., Movahedzadeh F., Martyn M., Dunning J., Why do students fail?

Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80% of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90% after the second college year and 99% after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Dropout risk; Graduation rate; Machine learning; Nursing education,"Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Educational Status; Humans; Machine Learning; Schools, Nursing; Students, Nursing; educational status; human; machine learning; nursing education; nursing student","Abele C., Penprase B., Ternes R., A closer look at academic probation and attrition: what courses are predictive of nursing student success?, Nurse Educ.

Additionally, at the University of California, Irvine (U CI), 57 % of students who were admitted and enrolled in the CS program between Fall 2011 and Fall 2015 failed to maintain satisfactory academic standing and entered academic probation. Of these probation students, 41 % entered probation during their first year. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning tools to identify the academic probation status of first-year CS students at an early stage, with the ultimate aim of providing timely support to those who are at the greatest risk of entering academic probation. We trained various classifiers on a dataset containing demo-graphic and academic performance variables for CS students at U CI, and performed feature analysis to identify the most influential variables. Since it is our priority to identify students who enter academic probation, our focus was on maximizing recall. The best-performing classifiers were Linear Support Vector Machines (recall of 0.838) and Logistic Regression (recall of 0.812). Our feature analysis revealed that ethnicity, student region, and having taken the Advanced Placement CS exam had a greater impact on the classification task than GPA and summer course enrollment. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include academic data available after enrollment to improve our current results. Our findings could also be applied to assess their impact in strategies for student retention in CS. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning tools to assist in identifying at-risk students in CS, and highlights the importance of considering a range of demographic and academic variables in this process. © 2023 IEEE.",academic performance prediction; academic probation; academic probation detection; computer science education; educational data mining; first-year pro-bation; machine learning,Classification (of information); Data mining; Education computing; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; Academic performance; Academic performance prediction; Academic probation; Academic probation detection; Computer Science Education; Educational data mining; First year; First-year pro-bation; Machine-learning; Performance prediction; Students,"Undergraduate Admissions Dashboard, (2022); Martinez Neda B., Wang M., Errahmouni Barkam H., Wong-Ma J., Gago-Masague S., Revisiting academic probation in cs: At-risk indicators and impact on student success, The Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, (2013); Gray G., McGuinness C., Owende P., An application of classification models to predict learner progression in tertiary education, 2014 Ieee International Advance Computing Conference (IACC, pp. 549-554, (2014); Hoffait A.-S., Schyns M., Early detection of university students with potential difficulties, Decision Support Systems, 101, pp. 1-11, (2017); Chytas K., Tsolakidis A., Karanikolas N.N., Skourlas C., An integrated system for predicting students' academic performance in smart universities, 24th Pan-Hellenic Conference on Informatics, Ser.

This is motivated by the belief that student analytics will help uncover patterns of behaviour and predict student performance, and thus facilitate the deployment of supportive educational interventions. This paper is concerned with the investigation of the institutional data of a Nigerian university, and the predictive impact of its attributes on student performance, measured in terms of cumulative grade point average (CGPA). The statistical analysis of the data set reveals that age and marital status have no significant relationship with final CGPA, whereas gender and pre-entry score have a weak relationship but are not good predictors. The application of four representative machine learning methods, namely linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree and random forests indicate that the third year CGPA is a good predictor of final year CGPA. A higher accuracy is achieved by using the aggregate value of the CGPAs of three previous years. Support vector regression has the best performance in predicting the final CGPA, whereas decision tree is the least performing model. © 2022 IEEE.",educational data; machine learning; regression; student analytics; student performance,Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Random forests; Regression analysis; Students; Cumulative grade point averages; Data set; Educational data; Institutional data analysis; Learning management system; Machine-learning; Student analytic; Student performance; Support vector regressions; Systematic analysis; Decision trees,"Tsai S.C., Chen C.H., Shiao Y.T., Ciou J.S., Wu T.N., Precision education with statistical learning and deep learning: A case study in Taiwan, Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); Prenkaj B., Velardi P., Stilo G., Distante D., Faralli S., A survey of machine learning approaches for student dropout prediction in online courses, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 53, 3, pp. 1-34, (2020); Tomasevic N., Gvozdenovic N., Vranes S., An overview and comparison of supervised data mining techniques for student exam performance prediction, Computers & education, 143, (2020); Yu R., Li Q., Fischer C., Doroudi S., Xu D., Towards Accurate and Fair Prediction of College Success: Evaluating Different Sources of Student Data, Int.

With the opening up and progress of society, the flow of talents in colleges and universities has become more and more frequent. Therefore, more and more attention has been paid to the analysis of factors affecting the turnover of outstanding college teachers. This paper establishes a random forest model to find out the key factors affecting the turnover of outstanding teachers in colleges and universities, and integrates these variables into an index to help colleges and universities understand which outstanding teachers need to be focused and predict the outstanding teachers on the job, and judge the probability of their departure., Which can formulate effective talent retention measures for the university managers. The experimental results verify that the work itself, work pressure and welfare remuneration are the most important factors affecting the turnover tendency of college teachers, followed by leadership management and development prospects. Relatively speaking, the impact of interpersonal relationships is the least. The evaluation model of university teachers' turnover intention based on the random forest model proposed in this paper can be further applied to the study of teacher turnover intention. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Data mining; decision tree; factor analysis; random forest; university teacher turnover,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Decision trees; Forecasting; Information systems; Information use; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Colleges and universities; Core competitiveness; Development prospects; Interpersonal relationship; Random forest modeling; System construction; Teachers in colleges and universities; University education; Data mining,"Setianto S.

In the era of Fourth industrial revolution, both Artificial Intelligence and RS technologies play important role in society around the globe. The acquisition of RS image data from satellite RS can be in a form of visible, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral. Various resolution are derived from this different image acquisition sources. Hyperspectral RS however has emerged as a great topic in the RS research society at large. Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have gained a lot of attention for image classification tasks. CNN makes use of gradient descent for optimization such as Adam, SGD, Adamax, Adadeta, Nadam and Adagrad. The gradient-based algorithms affect the output performance of the classification algorithm. In this study, we evaluate the impact of six DL optimization techniques, and the model performance of a 3D CNN in terms of accuracy. The experimental simulation is performed using publicly available hyperspectral dataset, which is called University of Pavia (UP). To avoid overfitting, dropout was utilized on the model. The results show that implementation of a 3D CNN HSI classification, performed better with Adam and Nadam. In future, we plan to run the optimization models to check the computational efficiency and fine-tune the models network structure and improved accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.",3D CNN; Deep Learning; Gradient Descent Optimization; Hyperspectral Image Classification; Supervised Classification,Computational efficiency; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Remote sensing; 3d convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Gradient descent optimization; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image classification; Optimization techniques; Remotely sensed images; Supervised classification; Technological advances; Gradient methods,"Farooq, Hu J., Jia X., Analysis of Spectral Bands and Spatial Resolutions for Weed Classification Via Deep Convolutional Neural Network, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 16, 2, pp. 183-187, (2019); Jia Z., Lu W., An end-to-end hyperspectral image classification method using deep convolutional neural network with spatial constraint, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 18, 10, pp. 1786-1790, (2021); Windrim L., Melkumyan A., Murphy R.J., Chlingaryan A., Ramakrishnan R., Pretraining for Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network Classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and RemoteSensing, 56, 5, pp. 2798-2810, (2018); Tong F., Zhang Y., Exploiting Spectral-Spatial Information Using Deep Random Forest for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 19, (2022); Niranjan S.K., Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Techniques, Electronics and Mechanical Systems (CTEMS-2018), (2018); Kalita I., Sai Kumar R.N., Roy M., Deep Learning-Based Cross-Sensor Domain Adaptation under Active Learning for Land Cover Classification, IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 19, (2022); Zhang X., Shang S., Tang X., Feng J., Jiao L., Spectral Partitioning Residual Network with Spatial Attention Mechanism for Hyperspectral Image Classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, (2022); Wang S., Et al., Using soil library hyperspectral reflectance and machine learning to predict soil organic carbon: Assessing potential of airborne and spaceborne optical soil sensing, Remote Sensing of Environment, 271, (2022); Ozdemir A., Polat K., Alhudhaif A., Classification of imbalanced hyperspectral images using SMOTE-based deep learning methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 178, (2021); Ansari M., Homayouni S., Safari A., Niazmardi S., A New Convolutional Kernel Classifier for Hyperspectral Image Classification, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 14, pp. 11240-11256, (2021); He X., Chen Y., Ghamisi P., Heterogeneous Transfer Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 58, 5, pp. 3246-3263, (2020); Kc K., Yin Z., Li B., Ma B., Wu M., Transfer Learning for Fine-Grained Crop Disease Classification Based on Leaf Images, Transfer Learning for Fine-Grained Crop Disease Classification Based on Leaf Images, (2019); Li S., Et al., Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification: An Overview; Nalepa J., Tulczyjew L., Myller M., Kawulok M., Segmenting Hyperspectral Images Using Spectral-Spatial Convolutional Neural Networks With Training-Time Data Augmentation; Ortac G., Ozcan G., Comparative study of hyperspectral image classification by multidimensional Convolutional Neural Network approaches to improve accuracy, Expert Systems with Applications, 182, (2021)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146415847,,

However, these investments have been hampered by unacceptable higher rates of school dropouts, which seriously affect female students, since most schools do not have effective mechanisms for quality data management for immediate and effective decision making. Therefore, this study aims to solve the problem of data management from the school level in order to assist higher levels to receive appropriate and effective data on time through the use of emerging technologies such as machine learning, QR codes, and mobile application. To implement this solution, the study has explored the predictors of school dropout using a mixed approach with questionnaires and interview discussion. 600 participants participated in problem identification in the Arusha region. Through the use of design science research methodology, Unified Modeling Language, MYSQL, QR codes and mobile application techniques were integrated with Support Vector Machine to develop the proposed solution. Finally, the evaluation process considered 100 participants, and the results showed that an average of 89% of participants provided positive feedback on the functionalities of the developed tool to prevent dropouts in secondary schools in Africa at large. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

It seems reasonable to assume that these applications would enhance student experiences and course satisfaction, and that therefore educational institutions should invest in these technologies to enhance their student offer. However, this should be tested empirically. In the current study a gender-balanced sample of 302 UK students rated course satisfaction, completed the General Attitudes towards AI Scale (GAAIS), comfortableness with AI educational applications, and course satisfaction if AI educational applications were adopted. Although students were, on average, moderately comfortable with AI educational applications, course satisfaction dropped in response to their hypothetical adoption. AI applications that assigned summative grades or that offered wellbeing support gave rise to the highest levels of discomfort. Students were more comfortable with career support, formative course support, and administrative support. Positive and Negative AI attitudes predicted the satisfaction difference, with mediation via comfortableness with applications. We recommend that Higher Education Institutions exercise caution before making major investments in AI educational applications. © 2023 The Authors",Comfortableness; Investment in artificial intelligence; Recruitment and retention; Student satisfaction; Technology acceptance,,"jamovi.

For this purpose, the structure of relational database is proposed, it will store the information about defended dissertations in the form of a set of attributes (heuristics), representing the mandatory qualification attributes of theses. An inference algorithm is proposed to process the information. This algorithm represents an artificial intelligence, its work is aimed at generating queries based on the applicant preferences. The result of the algorithm's work will be a set of choices, presented in ranked order. Given technologies will allow applicants to quickly become familiar with known scientific results and serve as a starting point for new research. The demand for co-researcher practice in solving the problem of updating the projective thinking methodology and managing the scientific research process has been justified. This article pays attention to the existing parallels between the concepts of technical and human sciences in the framework of their convergence. The concepts of being (economic good and economic utility) and the concepts of consciousness (humanitarian economic good and humanitarian economic utility) are used to form projective thinking. They form direct and inverse correspondences of technology and humanitarian practice in the techno-humanitarian mathematical space. It is proposed to place processed information from the language of context-free formal grammar dissertation abstracts in this space. The principle of data manipulation based on formal languages with context-free grammar allows to create new structures of subject areas in terms of applicants' preferences.It is believed that the success of applicants' work depends directly on the cognitive training of applicants, which needs to be practiced psychologically. This practice is based on deepening the objectivity and adequacy qualities of obtaining information on the basis of heuristic methods. It requires increased attention and development of intelligence. The paper studies the use of heuristic methods by applicants to find new research directions leads to several promising results. These results can be perceived as potential options in future research. This contributes to an increase in the level of retention of higher education professionals.  © 2022 IEEE.",convergence; data model; database management system; heuristic methods; intelligent technology; knowledge representation systems; projective thinking and management; subject area models,Context free grammars; Engineering education; Formal languages; Inference engines; Information management; Inverse problems; Knowledge representation; Convergence; Educational process; Higher education institutions; Intelligent technology; Knowledge representation system; Knowledge-representation; Projective thinking and management; Relational Database; Research management; Subject area model; Heuristic methods,"Eroshin S.E., Analiz sistemy upravlenya nauchnymi issledovaniyami [Research Management System Analysis], 6, pp. 42-45; Novikov D.A., Modeli i mechanizmy upravleniya nauchnymi proektami v VUZakh [Models and Mechanisms for Managing Research Projects in Higher Education Institutions], Text: digital. - Mode of access: open., (2005); Egorova Y., A.

An automatic recognition model of ancient building types is one possible application of asymmetric systems, and it will be of great significance to be able to identify ancient building types via machine vision. In the context of Chinese traditional ancient buildings, this paper proposes a recognition method of ancient buildings, based on the improved asymmetric Inception V3 model. Firstly, the improved Inception V3 model adds a dropout layer between the global average pooling layer and the SoftMax classification layer to solve the overfitting problem caused by the small sample size of the ancient building data set. Secondly, migration learning and the ImageNet dataset are integrated into model training, which improves the speed of network training while solving the problems of the small scale of the ancient building dataset and insufficient model training. Thirdly, through ablation experiments, the effects of different data preprocessing methods and different dropout rates on the accuracy of model recognition were compared, to obtain the optimized model parameters. To verify the effectiveness of the model, this paper takes the ancient building dataset that was independently constructed by the South China University of Technology team as the experimental data and compares the recognition effect of the improved Inception V3 model proposed in this paper with several classical models. The experimental results show that when the data preprocessing method is based on filling and the dropout rate is 0.3, the recognition accuracy of the model is the highest; the accuracy rate of identifying ancient buildings using our proposed improved Inception V3 model can reach up to 98.64%. Compared with other classical models, the model accuracy rate has increased by 17.32%, and the average training time has accelerated by 2.29 times, reflecting the advantages of the model proposed in this paper. Finally, the improved Inception V3 model was loaded into the ancient building identification system to prove the practical application value of this research. © 2022 by the authors.",ancient architecture classification; deep learning; dropout layer; Inception V3; transfer learning,,"Di H., Talking about digital technology in the protection of ancient buildings, Identif.

Studies have shown that such an emerging field in educational technology provides meaningful insights into several dimensions of educational quality. An in-depth analysis of the application of ML could have a positive impact on the HE sector. However, there is a scarcity of a systematic review of HE literature to gain from the overarching trends and patterns discovered using ML. This paper conducts a systematic review and meta-analyses of research studies that have reported on the application of ML in HE. The differentiating factors of this study are primarily vested in the meta-analyses including a specific focus on student academic performance, at-risk, and attrition in HE. Our detailed investigation adopts an evidence-based framework called PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for reporting the findings of our systematic review and meta-analyses of literature on the use of ML models, algorithms, evaluation metrics, and other criteria, including demographics for assessing student academic performance, at-risk and attrition in HE. After undergoing the PRISMA steps such as selection criteria and filtering, we arrive at a small-scale dataset of 89 relevant studies published from 2010 to 2020 for an in-depth analysis. The results show the outcomes of the quantitative analysis of the application of ML types, models, evaluation metrics, and other related demographics and provide quality insights of publication patterns and future trends towards predicting and monitoring student academic progress in HE. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Higher education; Machine leaning; Meta analysis; Systematic literature review,,"Adejo O.W., Connolly T., Predicting student academic performance using multi-model heterogeneous ensemble approach, Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 61-75, (2018); Adekitan A.I., Salau O., The impact of engineering students' performance in the first three years on their graduation result using educational data mining, Heliyon, 5, 2, (2019); Aderibigbe I.A., Noma-Osaghae E., Data mining approach to predicting the performance of first year student in a university using the admission requirements, Education and Information Technologies, 24, 2, pp. 1527-1543, (2019); Forecasting learner attrition for student success at a South African University, Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists 2020 (SAICSIT ’20), September 14–16, (2020); Aldowah H., Al-Samarraie H., Fauzy W.M., Educational data mining and learning analytics for 21st century higher education: A review and synthesis, Telematics and Informatics, 37, pp. 13-49, (2019); A machine-learning based approach to support academic decision-making at higher educational institutions. 2020 international symposium on networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC), (2020); Allah A.G.F., Using machine learning to support students’ academic decisions [article], Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 8, 10, pp. 3778-3796, (2020); Alshanqiti A., Namoun A., Predicting student performance and its influential factors using hybrid regression and multi-label classification [article], IEEE Access, 8, pp. 203827-203844, (2020); Predicting academic success in higher education: Literature review and best practices, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, (2020); Ashraf M., Zaman M., Ahmed M., Using ensemble StackingC method and base classifiers to ameliorate prediction accuracy of pedagogical data, Procedia Computer Science, 132, pp. 1021-1040, (2018); Aydogdu S., Predicting student final performance using artificial neural networks in online learning environments, Education and Information Technologies, 25, 3, pp. 1913-1927, (2020); Baneres D., Rodriguez-Gonzalez M.E., Serra M., An early feedback prediction system for learners at-risk within a first-year higher education course, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 12, 2, pp. 249-263, (2019); Baranyi M., Gal K., Molontay R., Szabo M., Modeling students’ academic performance using Bayesian networks, 2019 17Th International Conference on Emerging Elearning Technologies and Applications (ICETA), (2019); Baranyi M., Nagy M., Molontay R., ).

This paper explores the use and application of a probabilistic supervised machine learning technique for predicting university student dropout to obtain insights on the students at risk and prevent them from dropping out the studies. Data from a public university in the Republic of Kosovo were obtained and examined. The dataset comprises instances of students' dropouts for the past six academic years along with their demographics, grades, enrollment details etc. Logistic Regression, as one of the most widely used Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms, was used to build the model and produce the predictions. First, a statistical analysis was conducted and after the data preprocessing, logistic regression classifier was implemented. The results show that a high prediction accuracy was reached, with a percentage of 90%, and a F1 score of 0.85, indicating that the model is performing great and the predictions results are reliable.  © 2022 IEEE.",higher education; logistic regression; machine learning; numpy; scikit-learn; student dropout,Education computing; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Supervised learning; High educations; Learn+; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Numpy; Probabilistics; Regression techniques; Scikit-learn; Student dropout; Supervised machine learning; Students,"Moreno-Marcos P.M., Alario-Hoyos C., Munoz-Merino P.J., Kloos C.D., Prediction in MOOCs: A review and future research directions, Ieee Transactions on Learning Technologies, 12, 3, pp. 384-401; Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Baker R., Siemens G., Educational data mining and learning analytics, The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences, pp. 253-272, (2014); Behr A., Giese M., K Teguim H.D., Theune K., Early prediction of university dropouts-A random forest approach, Jahrböcher för Nationalökonomie und Statistik, 240, 6, pp. 743-789; Dekker G., Pechenizkiy M., Vleeshouwers J., Predicting students drop out: A case study, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM2009, pp. 41-50, (2009); Luan J., Data mining and its applications in higher education, New Directions for Institutional Research, 2002, 113, pp. 17-36, (2002); Shields L., Newman A., Satz D., Equality of Educational Opportunity; Kemper L., Vorhoff G., Wigger B.U., Predicting student dropout: A machine learning approach, European Journal of Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 28-47; Fernandez-Garcia A.J., Preciado J.C., Melchor F., Rodriguez-Echeverria R., Conejero J.M., Sanchez-Figueroa F., A real-life machine learning experience for predicting university dropout at different stages using academic data, Ieee Access, 9, pp. 133076-133090, (2021); Kabathova J., Drlik M., Towards predicting student?s dropout in university courses using different machine learning techniques, Applied Sciences, 11, 7; Niyogisubizo J., Liao L., Nziyumva E., Murwanashyaka E., Nshimyumukiza P.C., Predicting student?s dropout in university classes using two-layer ensemble machine learning approach: A novel stacked generalization, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Ujkani B., Minkovska D., Stoyanova L., A machine learning approach for predicting student enrollment in the university, 2021 Xxx International Scientific Conference Electronics (ET), (2021)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141497958,,

Unfortunately, among U.S. undergraduate curricula, STEM has one of the highest attrition rates (Tinto 1993) with less than half of students in the U.S. that enroll in an undergraduate STEM program ultimately receiving a degree in a STEM field (Hayes 2009). Naturally, the high rate of attrition is a topic of persisting concern. Many programs have been designed and implemented to model best practices in retaining students in STEM disciplines. One retention strategy is to engage STEM undergraduates in research experiences, and a number of programs have been implemented to provide such experiences. The Towson University Research Enhancement Program (TU REP) is one such program. This cohort-based program supports faculty in the development of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). In this note we describe a CURE in machine learning offered by the Towson University Department of Mathematics whose development was supported by TU REP.

The prediction allows to identify the students who are going to desert early, so that the directors of the Universities can establish strategies to mitigate it. Machine Learning methods are the most recent and effective for this problem. However, so far these methods have been applied independently and not in combination. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on decision trees and neural networks, designed following the KDD methodology, to predict with high precision the university student dropout. The proposal was implemented in Rapid Miner Studio 6.4 and applied to a dataset with 1761 student records and 53 variables for training. Through a variable selection procedure that includes 8 algorithms, 27 variables were selected. The results on 100 new records show an accuracy of 87%, 91%, 98% for decision tree models, neural networks and stacking respectively. In addition, the result of sensitivity is 90.6%, 93.3%, 98.7% for decision trees, neural networks and stacking respectively. Regarding specificity, 76%, 84% and 96% have been obtained for decision trees, neural networks and stacking respectively. The results of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity also show that the hybrid model presents better results than the separate models.. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific",Decision trees; Hybrid Model; Neural Networks; Prediction; Stacking; University Dropout,,"Mino M., Factores condicionantes de la deserción universitaria, Ciencia Latina Revista Científica Multidisciplinar, 5, 4, pp. 5316-5328, (2021); Caceres E., Alejandra M., Impacto del COVID-19 en la deserción universitaria de las carreras empresariales, Revista Científica UNE, 3, 1, pp. 40-50, (2021); Miranda Rodriguez V., Alarcon Diaz H., Efectos de los factores de riesgo sobre la interrupción de los estudios en jóvenes universitarios durante la covid-19, Desde el Sur, 13, 2, (2021); Hanson M., College Dropout Rates [Internet], (2021); Nunez A., Deserción y retención: retos en la educación superior, Revista Científica Retos de la Cienca, 4, 9, pp. 15-23, (2020); Noguera S., Estudio en Brasil revela que 42% de los alumnos abandonaría universidades privadas por la COVID-19 [Insternet], (2020); Torres Renteria S., Escobar Jimenez C., Determinantes de la deserción y permanencia en la carrera de Medicina: Evidencia del Sistema de Educación Superior ecuatoriano, Revista Andina de Educación, 5, 1, pp. 1-6, (2022); Albornoz N., Análisis de la deserción estudiantil en institutos de educación superior tecnológicos durante el periodo 2014-2017, región Junín, (2019); Urteaga I., Siri L., Garofalo G., Predicción temprana de deserción mediante aprendizaje automático en cursos profesionales en línea, RIED, 23, 2, pp. 147-161, (2020); Felizzola H., Jaime Y., Castillo A., Villa F., Modelo de predicción para la deserción temprana en la Facultad De Ingeniería De La Universidad De La Salle, Gestión, Calidad y Desarrollo en las Facultades De Ingeniería, pp. 1-8, (2018); Daza A., Un modelo basado en árboles de decisión para predecir la deserción estudiantil en la Educación Superior Privada, UCV-Scientia, 8, 1, pp. 59-73, (2016); Alvarado J., estudio comparativo del nivel de eficacia en modelos algorítmicos al estimar la deserción de los estudiantes del nivel pregrado en la universidad de huánuco - 2019, (2022); Gulati H., Predictive analytics using data mining technique, 2015 2nd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom), pp. 713-716, (2015); Huillca J, Quispe R, Sistema inteligente para la predicción del precio diario de las acciones mineras en la Bolsa de Valores de New York usando un modelo híbrido de redes neuronales y máquina de soporte vectorial de regresión, (2019); Deepa V., Muthamil Sudar K., Deepalakshmi P., Detection of DDoS Attack on SDN Control plane using Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques, International Conference on Smart Systems and Inventive Technology (ICSSIT 2018), (2018); Dahiya Shashi, Handa S.S, Singh N.P, Credit Modelling using Hybrid Machine Learning Technique, 2015 International Conference on Soft Computing Techniques and Implementations- (ICSCTI), (2015); Gamboa J., Salinas J., Predicción de la situación académica en alumnos de pregrado usando algoritmos de machine learning, Perfiles, 1, 27, pp. 1-7, (2022); Henriquez C., Salcedo D., Sanchez G., El aprendizaje automático en entornos educativos universitarios: Caso deserción académica, Prospectiva, 20, 1, pp. 1-12, (2022); Urbina A., Tellez A., Cruz R., Patrones que identifican a estudiantes universitarios desertores aplicando minería de datos educativa, Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa, 23, 29, pp. 1-15, (2021); Fernandez A., Preciado J., Melchor F., Rodriguez R., Conejero J., Sanchez F., A Real-Life Machine Learning Experience for Predicting University Dropout at Different Stages Using Academic Data, IEE Access, 9, 1, pp. 1-15, (2021); Ma X., Zhou Z., Student pass rates prediction using optimized support vector machine and decision tree, 2018 IEEE 8th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC), pp. 209-215, (2018); Kemper L., Vorhoff G., Wigger B., Predicting student dropout: A machine learning approach, European Journal of Higher Education, 10, 3, pp. 1-20, (2021); Kostopoulos G., Kotsiantis S., Ragos O., Grapsa T., Early dropout prediction in distance higher education using active learning, 2017 8th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA), pp. 1-6, (2017); Gonzalez J., Penaloza M., Identificación y predicción de estudiantes en riesgo de deserción académica por medio de modelos basados en machine learning, Los Libertadores Fundación Universitaria, pp. 1-16, (2021); Urteaga I., Siri L., Garofalo G., Predicción temprana de deserción mediante aprendizaje automático en cursos profesionales en línea, RIED.

Attrition occurs when an employee leaves a job for any reason. The attrition factor is faced in many organizations, in nominated educational colleges, or universities. Attrition is gradual reduction in number of employees. Finding the right individuals with the correct talents employed at the right location and time can be costly for an organization in the event of attrition. Due to attrition, employees create instability in their lives. We focus on finding out which employee is beneficial to the organization and why he is leaving the organization using ML models, and ensemble models. We focus on creating our dataset of the college by taking a questionnaire survey. The two main factors that are responsible for attrition are 'job satisfaction and salary'.  © 2023 IEEE.",attrition prediction; Deep learning models; employee attrition; Ensembles models; ML models,Deep learning; Learning systems; % reductions; Attrition prediction; Deep learning model; Employee attrition; Ensemble learning; Ensemble models; Learning models; Machine-learning; ML model; Questionnaire surveys; Job satisfaction,"Al-Darraji S., Honi D.G., Fallucchi F., Abdulsada A.I., Giuliano R., Abdulmalik H.A., Employee Attrition Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks, MDPI, 10, 11, (2021); Harsha B.S., Varaprasad A.J., Sujith L.V.N.P.S., Early Prediction of Employee Attrition, International Journel of Science and Research, 9, (2020); Ci Z.T., Shu S.W., Zhao P., Research on the Prediction of Employee Turnover Behavior and Its Interpretability, ACM, (2021); Chaudhary M., Gaur L., Jhanjhi N.Z., Masud M., Aljahdali S., Envisaging Employee Churn Using MCDM and Machine Learning, Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, (2021); Mansor N., Aliff M., Machine Learning for Predicting Employee Attrition, IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 36, 4, (2021); Jain P.K., Jain M., Pamula R., Explaining and predicting employee's attrition: A machine learning approach, 2, 4, (2020); Alduayj S.S., Rajpoot K., Predicting Employee Attrition using Machine Learning, IEEE, (2018); Mhatre A., Mahalingam A., Narayanan M., Nair A., Jaju S., Predicting Employee Attrition along with Identifying High Risk Employees using Big Data and Machine Learning, 2020 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN), pp. 269-276, (2020); Fallucchi F., Coladangelo M., Giuliano R., De Luca E.W., Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning Techniques, MDPI, 9, 4, (2020); Subhashini M., Gopinath D.R., Employee Attrition Prediction In Industry Using Machine Learning Techniques, IJARET(Scopus Index), 11, 12, (2020); Sadana P., Munnuru D., Machine Learning Model to Predict Work Force Attrition, International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT, (2021); Eduvie R., Nwaukwa J.C., Uloko F., Taniform E., Predicting Employee Attrition using Decision tree algorithm, Global Scientific Journals, 9, 9, (2021); Joseph M.R., Udupa M.S., Jangale M.S., Kotkar M.K., Pawar M.P., Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning And Depression Analysis, IEEE, (2021); Tran O.T., Nguyen L.P., Trainee Churn Prediction using Machine Learning: A Case Study of Data Scientist Job, Conference on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (CHAI), (2021); Qutub A., Al-Mehmadi A., Al-Hssan M., Aljohani R., Alghamdi H.S., Prediction of Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning and Ensemble Methods, International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, 11, (2021); Ahmed T.M., A Novel Classification Model for Employees Turnover Using Neural Network to Enhance Job Satisfaction in Organizations, JIOS, 45, 2, (2021); Ruchitha R., Hariprasad M., Employee attrition prediction using stacking and its evaluation, IIRJET, (2021); Borle P., Karnawar A., Mandhare M., Pawar P., An In-depth Review on eSolution-Solution to People Leaving Job, JETIR, (2021)","A.

Predictive analytics research seeks to build models that identify at-risk students and suggest interventions that enhance student success. This study examines whether incorporating a novel assessment type (concept inventories [CI]) and using machine learning (ML) methods (1) improves prediction quality, (2) reduces the time point of successful prediction, and (3) suggests more actionable course-level interventions. A corpus of university and course-level assessment and non-assessment variables (53 variables in total) from 3225 students (over six semesters) was gathered. Five ML methods were employed (two individuals, three ensembles) at three time points (pre-course, week 3, week 6) to quantify predictive efficacy. Inclusion of course-specific CI data along with university-specific corpora significantly improved prediction performance. Ensemble ML methods, in particular the generalized linear model with elastic net (GLMNET), yielded significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) values compared with non-ensemble techniques. Logistic regression achieved the poorest prediction performance and consistently underperformed. Surprisingly, increasing corpus size (i.e., amount of historical data) did not meaningfully impact prediction success. We discuss the roles that novel assessment types and ML techniques may play in advancing predictive learning analytics and addressing attrition in undergraduate science education. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Assessment; Concept inventories; Course- vs. institution-specific data sources; Introductory biology; Machine learning; Predictive learning analytics,,"Ade R., Deshmukh P.R., Classification of students by using an incremental ensemble of classifiers, Proceedings of the 3Rd International Conference on Reliability, pp. 1-5, (2014); Adekitan A.I., Noma-Osaghae E., Data mining approach to predicting the performance of first year student in a university using the admissions requirement, Education and Information Technologies, 24, 2, pp. 1527-1543, (2019); Alexandro D., Aiming for Success: Evaluating Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Predict High School Student Performance and Improve Early Warning Systems, (Doctoral Dissertation).

An established approach entails training classification models from past learner-related data in order to predict the exam success rate of a student well before the end of the course. Early predictions allow teachers to put in place targeted actions, e.g., supporting at-risk students to avoid exam failures or course dropouts. Although several machine learning and data mining solutions have been proposed to learn accurate predictors from past data, the interpretability and explainability of the best performing models is often limited. Therefore, in most cases, the reasons behind classifiers’ decisions remain unclear. This paper proposes an Explainable Learning Analytics solution to analyze learner-generated data acquired by our technical university, which relies on a blended learning model. It adopts classification techniques to early predict the success rate of about 5000 students who were enrolled in the first year courses of our university. It proposes to apply associative classifiers at different time points and to explore the characteristics of the models that led to assign pass or fail success rates. Thanks to their inherent interpretability, associative models can be manually explored by domain experts with the twofold aim at validating classifier outcomes through local rule-based explanations and identifying at-risk/successful student profiles by interpreting the global rule-based model. The results of an in-depth empirical evaluation demonstrate that associative models (i) perform as good as the best performing classification models, and (ii) give relevant insights into the per-student success rate assignments. © 2021 by the authors.

Novelty detection offers a solution to this problem by detecting anomalies through learning only the normal data. This study implements a novelty detection method as a one-class classification to detect early signs of failure in a rolling bearing using long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder. LSTM autoencoder is a deep learning algorithm combining an autoencoder and LSTM network to reconstruct the normal data to learn nonlinear relationships and temporal nature. The model was tested on historical multivariate time-series fault data provided by Case Western Reserve University. The dropout layer is implemented to reduce overfitting by creating an ensemble model of a neural network. The results suggested that the LSTM autoencoder can effectively differentiate between normal and fault patterns of the bearing with up to 92 % accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; deep learning; LSTM autoencoder; novelty detection; predictive maintenance; rolling bearing,Brain; Industrial plants; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Roller bearings; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Detection methods; Failure data; High complexity; Long short-term memory autoencoder; Novelty detection; Operational conditions; Predictive maintenance; Rolling bearings; Long short-term memory,"Zhou K., Liu T., Zhou L., Industry 4. 0: Towards future industrial opportunities and challenges, 2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD), (2015); Mobley R.K., Plant Engineering, An Introduction to Predictive Maintenance, (2002); Ran Y., Zhou X., Lin P., Wen Y., Deng R., A survey of predictive maintenance: Systems, purposes and approaches; Naskos A., Gounaris A., Metaxa I., Kochling D., Detecting anomalous behavior towards predictive maintenance, Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 349, pp. 73-82, (2019); Pimentel M.A.F., Clifton D.A., Clifton L., Tarassenko L., A review of novelty detection, Signal Processing, 99, pp. 215-249, (2014); Zarei J., Poshtan J., Bearing fault detection using wavelet packet transform of induction motor stator current, Tribology International, 40, 5, pp. 763-769, (2007); Kamat P., Sugandhi R., Anomaly detection for predictive maintenance in industry 4. 0-A survey, E3S Web of Conferences, 170, (2020); Hsieh R.J., Chou J., Ho C.H., Unsupervised online anomaly detection on multivariate sensing time series data for smart manufacturing, 2019 IEEE 12th Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA), pp. 90-97, (2019); Loparo K.A., Case western reserve university bearing data center, Bearings Vibration Data Sets, Case Western Reserve University, pp. 22-28, (2012); Neupane D., Seok J., Bearing fault detection and diagnosis using Case Western Reserve University dataset with deep learning approaches: A review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 93155-93178, (2020); Shi H., Guo L., Tan S., Bai X., Rolling bearing initial fault detection using long short-term memory recurrent network, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 171559-171569, (2019); Kamat P., Marni P., Cardoz L., Irani A., Gajula A., Saha A., Kumar S., Sugandhi R., Bearing fault detection using comparative analysis of random forest, ANN, and autoencoder methods, Communication and Intelligent Systems, pp. 157-171, (2021); Park P., Marco P.D., Shin H., Bang J., Fault detection and diagnosis using combined autoencoder and long short-term memory network, Sensors, 19, 21, (2019); Li Z., Li J., Wang Y., Wang K., A deep learning approach for anomaly detection based on SAE and LSTM in mechanical equipment, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 103, 1-4, pp. 499-510, (2019); Bampoula X., Siaterlis G., Nikolakis N., Alexopoulos K., A deep learning model for predictive maintenance in cyber-physical production systems using LSTM autoencoders, Sensors, 21, 3, (2021); Del Buono F., Calabrese F., Baraldi A., Paganelli M., Regattieri A., Data-driven predictive maintenance in evolving environments: A comparison between machine learning and deep learning for novelty detection, Sustainable Design and Manufacturing, pp. 109-119, (2021); Kruachottikul P., Cooharojananone N., Phanomchoeng G., Chavarnakul T., Kovitanggoon K., Trakulwaranont D., Deep learning-based visual defect-inspection system for reinforced concrete bridge substructure: A case of Thailand's department of highways, Journal of Civil Structural Health Monitoring, 11, 4, pp. 949-965, (2021); Kruachottikul P., Cooharojananone N., Phanomchoeng G., Chavarnakul T., Kovitanggoon K., Trakulwaranont D., Atchariyachanvanich K., Bridge sub structure defect inspection assistance by using deep learning, 2019 IEEE 10th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology (iCAST), (2019)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140601095,,

Metacognitive processes play a vital role in self-regulated learning. Students become active participants in their learning, and one critical aspect of higher education studies is planning and time management. The exam taking behaviour is in the context of the FME manifestation of the time management skills of each student; thus, the exam-taking patterns may help identify at-risk students. To evaluate the importance of exam behaviour patterns, we conducted three experiments. Identification of students passing or failing the first study year has been conducted using four different machine learning models. The exam taking behaviour patterns increase the prediction F-measure significantly for the class of failing students (approximately 0.3 increase). Moreover, the approach based on student behaviour enabled us to identify the critical exam-taking patterns, which further helps the lecturers identify at-risk students and improve their time management skills and chances to pass the first academic year. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioural patterns; Exam behaviour; Predictive modelling; Student dropout,Education computing; Behavioral patterns; Behaviour patterns; Drop-out; Exam behavior; Faculty of mechanical engineerings; Management skills; Predictive models; Student dropout; Student success; Technical universities; Students,"The log-on degree; technology and universities, The Economist (US), (2015); Quinn J., Drop-out and completion in higher education in Europe, (2013); Kabra R., Bichkar R., Performance prediction of engineering students using decision trees, Int.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread across a variety of disciplines, including K-12 education, and more financial institutions move towards digitizing their services, the demand for AI systems in financial literacy education is growing. While many financial and educational institutions alike have implemented AI systems, there remains a need for a system geared toward teaching young students these important lessons and skills. To address this demand, we have created an AI system equipped with financial literacy lessons for grade school students. The system, which is embedded into a NAO robot, a humanoid robot designed for use within education, was evaluated on its performance in the classroom across multiple metrics, including its effcacy, its robustness and feasibility in the classroom, and the students' enjoyment in using it. The results from the experiments suggest that the system did result in the retention of material, but did not do so at a significantly different level than the more traditional teaching method of a guided worksheet. However, the students did report higher levels of enjoyment in using the robot when compared to a worksheet. These results show promise for future uses of the system, as well as shed light on areas in which the system can be improved in the future.  © 2023 IEEE.",,Finance; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence systems; Critical fields; Educational institutions; Embodied artificial intelligence; Financial decisions; Financial institution; Financial literacy; K-12 education; School students; Social robots; Anthropomorphic robots,"Islam M.M., Iqbal T., Multi-gat: A graphical attention-based hierarchical multimodal representation learning approach for human activity recognition, IEEE RA-L, (2021); Islam M.M., Yasar M.S., Iqbal T., Maven: A memory augmented recurrent approach for multimodal fusion, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, pp. 1-1, (2022); Yasar M.S., Iqbal T., A scalable approach to predict multi-agent motion for human-robot collaboration, RA-L, (2021); Green H.N., Islam M.M., Ali S., Iqbal T., Who's laughing nao. examining perceptions of failure in a humorous robot partner, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, (2022); Iqbal T., Rack S., Riek L.D., Movement coordination in human-robot teams: A dynamical systems approach, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, (2016); Islam M.M., Iqbal T., Hamlet: A hierarchical multimodal attentionbased human activity recognition algorithm, 2020 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 10285-10292, (2020); Iqbal T., Riek L.D., Human robot teaming: Approaches from joint action and dynamical systems, Humanoid Robotics: A Reference, pp. 2293-2312, (2017); Islam M.M., Iqbal T., Mumu: Cooperative multitask learning-based guided multimodal fusion, Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2022); Yasar M.S., Iqbal T., Improving human motion prediction through continual learning, ACM/IEEE Int.

Box 11099, Taif, 21944, Saudi Arabia","Alcoholism is attributed to regular or excessive drinking of alcohol and leads to the disturbance of the neuronal system in the human brain. This results in certain malfunctioning of neurons that can be detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) using several electrodes on a human skull at appropriate positions. It is of great interest to be able to classify an EEG activity as that of a normal person or an alcoholic person using data from the minimum possible electrodes (or channels). Due to the complex nature of EEG signals, accurate classification of alcoholism using only a small dataset is a challenging task. Artificial neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provide efficient and accurate results in various pattern-based classification problems. In this work, we apply CNN on raw EEG data and demonstrate how we achieved 98% average accuracy by optimizing a baseline CNN model and outperforming its results in a range of performance evaluation metrics on the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning (UCI-ML) EEG dataset. This article explains the stepwise improvement of the baseline model using the dropout, batch normalization, and kernel regularization techniques and provides a comparison of the two models that can be beneficial for aspiring practitioners who aim to develop similar classification models in CNN. A performance comparison is also provided with other approaches using the same dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

In many educational institutions, high student attrition rates are due to a variety of circumstances, including demographic and personal factors such as age, gender, academic background, financial abilities, and academic degree of choice. In this study, we will make use of machine learning approaches to develop prediction models that can predict student enrollment behavior and the students who have a high risk of dropping out. This can help higher education institutions develop proper intervention plans to reduce attrition rates and increase the probability of student academic success. In this study, real data is taken from Abu Dhabi School of Management (ADSM) in the UAE. This data is used in developing the student enrollment model and identifying the student’s characteristics who are willing to enroll in a specific program, in addition to that, this research managed to find out the characteristics of the students who are under the risk of dropout. © 2021, Zarka Private University.

While the APS appears helpful to gauge the aptitude of a learner and predict their success, the reality is that between 2008 and 2015 almost 50% of learners who made the required APS for a Science programme failed to complete the requirements for that programme. This paper delineates and diagnoses learner vulnerability, using a learner attrition model, for early intervention and as an alternative to using the APS. The analysis shows that various predictive models achieve higher accuracy to predict learner vulnerability, by incorporating factors of the learner attrition model, rather than just using the APS score. This paper argues for a more complex view of predicting learner vulnerability for early interventions by incorporating the learner’s background, individual characteristics, and schooling data. It does not agree with the aggregation of National Senior Certificate (NSC) subjects into APS scores since this normalises the complexity of the subtle relations between the schooling system, learner attrition, and pre-schooling pedagogical dynamics. This paper points to a more nuanced view of predicting learner vulnerability. © the author(s); published under a Creative Commons NonCommercial 4.0 License",Early intervention; Education; Identifying at-risk learners; Model-based machine learning; Predicting learner vulnerability; South african highereducation universities,,"Ajoodha R., Dukhan S., Jadhav A., Data-driven student support for academic success by developing student skill profiles, 2nd International Multidisciplinary Information Technology and Engineering Conference (IMITEC 2020), pp. 1-8, (2020); Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., Dukhan S., Forecasting learner attrition for student success at a South African university, Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SAICSIT 2020), pp. 19-28, (2020); Arsad P.

Higher education institutions have started to utilize analytical tools to improve students’ grades and retention. Prediction of students’ performance is a difficult process owing to the massive quantity of educational data. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be used for educational data mining in a big data environ-ment. At the same time, in EDM, the feature selection process becomes necessary in creation of feature subsets. Since the feature selection performance affects the predictive performance of any model, it is important to elaborately investigate the outcome of students’ performance model related to the feature selection techni-ques. With this motivation, this paper presents a new Metaheuristic Optimiza-tion-based Feature Subset Selection with an Optimal Deep Learning model (MOFSS-ODL) for predicting students’ performance. In addition, the proposed model uses an isolation forest-based outlier detection approach to eliminate the existence of outliers. Besides, the Chaotic Monarch Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (CBOA) is used for the selection of highly related features with low complexity and high performance. Then, a sailfish optimizer with stacked sparse autoencoder (SFO-SSAE) approach is utilized for the classification of educational data. The MOFSS-ODL model is tested against a benchmark student’s performance data set from the UCI repository. A wide-ranging simulation analysis por-trayed the improved predictive performance of the MOFSS-ODL technique over recent approaches in terms of different measures. Compared to other methods, experimental results prove that the proposed (MOFSS-ODL) classification model does a great job of predicting students’ academic progress, with an accuracy of 96.49%. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Maritime higher education is an essential element in acquiring the knowledge, and skills needed on board a ship. One of the indicators of potential problems in this educational process may be a high number of dropouts in the early years. Predicting student success and dropout, or identifying students who are at higher risk for dropping out, is critical to improving the quality of higher education. An analysis of the academic performance of students at the University of Split, Faculty of Maritime Studies (PFST) was conducted a high dropout rate was revealed. This research aims to improve early prediction of student dropout by identifying the most relevant features. The data is processed and the features that influence dropout are extracted through an attribute selection algorithm and machine learning techniques such as a random forest. The results of our research suggest that higher education institutions should be aware of the need to identify early the profile of students who are at potential risk of dropping out. Moreover, the developed model is useful for strategic planning of additional mechanisms to improve the efficiency of study at maritime higher education institutions. © 2022 IAMUC.

To address said scarcity, this paper introduces Sentinel: a multi-enterprise scientific instrument developed to support data-driven cybersecurity research. Sentinel provides researchers access to virtual computing infrastructure and petabytes of data collected over several years from network sensors at two large, disjoint educational institutions - the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech. The network dataset is supplemented by multi-modal malware activity logs generated by attack recreation exercises which realistically integrate ground truth into collected edge sensor data. To mitigate risks associated with providing access to enterprise network sensor logs, Sentinel uses a combination of a code-to-data policy, data usage agreements, and pattern-preserving anonymization. Sentinel has been used as part of a government-funded effort to investigate new machine learning algorithms, cybersecurity forensics, and data retention techniques. © 2022 IEEE.",cybersecurity; dataset; malware; network sensors,Cybersecurity; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; 'current; Computing infrastructures; Cyber security; Data driven; Dataset; Malwares; Network sensors; Network traffic; Scientific instrument; Virtual computing; Malware,"Thuraisingham B., Kantarcioglu M., Hamlen K., Khan L., Finin T., Joshi A., Oates T., Bertino E., A Data Driven Approach for the Science of Cyber Security: Challenges and Directions, 2016 IEEE 17th International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI), pp. 1-10, (2016); Heidemann J., Mirkovic J., Hardaker W., Kallitsis M., Collecting, Labeling, and Using Networking Data: The Intersection of AI and Networking, NSF Workshop on AI for Networking.

It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise. © 2022 The Authors",Agents of education; Artificial intelligence; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Student dropout prediction,,"Alamri A., Alshehri M., Cristea A., Pereira F.D., Oliveira E., Shi L., Stewart C., Predicting MOOCs dropout using only two easily obtainable features from the first week's activities, International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, (2019); Aparna K., Nair M.K., Effect of outlier detection on clustering accuracy and computation time of CHB K-means algorithm, Computational intelligence in data mining, 2, pp. 25-35, (2016); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting student dropout in higher education, (2016); Baker R.S., Inventado P.S., Educational data mining and learning analytics, Learning analytics, pp. 61-75, (2014); Balfanz R., Herzog L., Mac Iver D.J., Preventing student disengagement and keeping students on the graduation path in urban middle-grades schools: Early identification and effective interventions, Educational Psychologist, 42, 4, pp. 223-235, (2007); Bentejac C., Csorgo A., Martinez-Munoz G., A comparative analysis of gradient boosting algorithms, Artificial Intelligence Review, 54, 3, pp. 1937-1967, (2021); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Catterall J.S., On the social costs of dropping out of school, High School Journal, 71, 1, pp. 19-30, (1987); Chen T., Guestrin C., Xgboost: A scalable tree boosting system, Proceedings of the 22nd acm sigkdd international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, (2016); Chen T., He T., Benesty M., Khotilovich V., Tang Y., Cho H., Xgboost: Extreme gradient boosting, R package version 0, 1, 4, pp. 1-4, (2015); Chen X., Zou D., Cheng G., Xie H., Detecting latent topics and trends in educational technologies over four decades using structural topic modeling: A retrospective of all volumes of computers & education, Computers & Education, 151, (2020); Chen X., Zou D., Xie H., Cheng G., Liu C., Two decades of artificial intelligence in education: Contributors, collaborations, research topics, challenges, and future directions, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 25, 1, (2022); Clark L.A., Pregibon D., Tree-based models, Statistical models in S, pp. 377-419, (2017); Del Bonifro F., Gabbrielli M., Lisanti G., Zingaro S.P., Student dropout prediction, International conference on artificial intelligence in education, (2020); Drlik M., Munk M., Skalka J., Identification of changes in VLE stakeholders' behavior over time using frequent patterns mining, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 23795-23813, (2021); Dynarski M., Gleason P., How can we help?

The study describes the methodology employed to select 31 papers from a repository of 2,745 reported in the literature. The analysis centered on the main AI methods used and four categories of explanatory factors of university dropout: academic factors; factors associated with motivation and study habits; institutional factors; and economic and sociodemographic factors. The conclusion drawn from this literature review is that AI is most commonly used for decision tree-based classification, and most studies focus on predicting university dropout on the basis of explanatory factors. © (2023).

Most works tend to optimize the detection model via exploiting the most contributed region, thereby to be dominated by the most discriminative part of an object. Meanwhile, these methods ignore the consistency across different spatial transformations of the same image and always label them with different classes, which introduces potential ambiguities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a unique self-supervised adversarial and equivariant network (SAENet) and aim at learning complementary and consistent visual patterns for WSOD in RSIs. To this end, an adversarial dropout–activation block is first designed to facilitate the entire object detector via adaptively hiding the discriminative parts and highlighting the instance-related regions. Besides, we further introduce a flexible self-supervised transformation equivariance mechanism on each potential instance from multiple spatial transformations to obtain spatially consistent self-supervisions. Accordingly, the obtained supervisions can be leveraged to pursue a more robust and spatially consistent object detector. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging LEarning, VIsion and Remote sensing Laboratory (LEVIR), NorthWestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) VHR-10.v2, and detection in optical RSIs (DIOR) datasets validate that SAENet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art works and achieves 46.2%, 60.7%, and 27.1% mAP, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.",Annotations; Detectors; Object detection; Proposals; Remote sensing; Task analysis; Transforms,Object recognition; Remote sensing; Detection models; Different class; Equivariance; Object detectors; Remote sensing images; Spatial transformation; State of the art; Visual pattern; artificial neural network; detection method; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; supervised classification; Object detection,"Hong D., Et al., More diverse means better: Multimodal deep learning meets remote-sensing imagery classification, Ieee Trans.

This study aims to focus on implementing a method to predict student attrition in the upper years of a physiotherapy program. Design/methodology/approach: Machine learning is a computer tool that can recognize patterns and generate predictive models. Using a quantitative research methodology, a database of 336 university students in their upper-year courses was accessed. The participant's data were collected from the Financial Academic Management and Administration System and a platform of Universidad Autónoma de Chile. Five quantitative and 11 qualitative variables were chosen, associated with university student attrition. With this database, 23 classifiers were tested based on supervised machine learning. Findings: About 23.58% of males and 17.39% of females were among the attrition student group. The mean accuracy of the classifiers increased based on the number of variables used for the training. The best accuracy level was obtained using the “Subspace KNN” algorithm (86.3%). The classifier “RUSboosted trees” yielded the lowest number of false negatives and the higher sensitivity of the algorithms used (78%) as well as a specificity of 86%. Practical implications: This predictive method identifies attrition students in the university program and could be used to improve student retention in higher grades. Originality/value: The study has developed a novel predictive model of student attrition from upper-year courses, useful for unbalanced databases with a lower number of attrition students. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data classification; Student attrition; Supervised machine learning; University student,,"Adejo W., Connolly T., Predicting student academic performance using multi-model heterogeneous ensemble approach, Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 61-75, (2018); Agarwal S., Pandey G.N., Tiwari M.D., Data mining in education: data classification and decision tree approach, International Journal of E-Education, e-Business, e-Management and e-Learning, 2, 2, pp. 140-145, (2012); Amaya K., Barrientos E., Heredia J., Modelo predictivo de deserción estudiantil utilizando técnicas de minería de datos, Mining Techniques, 13, 9, pp. 3127-3134, (2014); Declaración de Helsinki de la AMM – Principios éticos para las investigaciones médicas en seres humanos – WMA – The World Medical Association, (2000); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting student dropout in higher education, ICML Workshop on #Data4Good: Machine Learning in Social Good Applications, (2016); Bedregal-Alpaca N., Cornejo-Aparicio V., Zarate-Valderrama J., Yanque-Churo P., Classification models for determining types of academic risk and predicting dropout in university students, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 1, (2020); Bowers A.J., Grades and graduation: a longitudinal risk perspective to identify student dropouts, The Journal of Educational Research, 103, 3, pp. 191-207, (2010); Bravo S., Cruz J., Estudios de exactitud diagnóstica: Herramientas para su Interpretación Diagnostic accuracy studies: tools for its interpretation, Revista Chilena de Radiología.

Every semester, the students respond to a pedagogical survey that aims to collect the student opinion of curricular units in terms of content and teaching methodologies. Using this information, we intend to anticipate the success in higher-level courses and prevent dropouts. Specifically, this paper contributes with an interpretable student classification method. The proposed solution relies on (i) a pedagogical survey to collect student’s opinions; (ii) a statistical data analysis to validate the reliability of the survey; and (iii) machine learning algorithms to classify the success of a student. In addition, the proposed method includes an explainable mechanism to interpret the classifications and their main factors. This transparent pipeline was designed to have implications in both digital and sustainable education, impacting the three pillars of sustainability, i.e.,economic, social, and environmental, where transparency is a cornerstone. The work was assessed with a dataset from a Portuguese higher-level institution, contemplating multiple courses from different departments. The most promising results were achieved with Random Forest presenting 98% in accuracy and F-measure. © 2022 by the authors.",classification; data analysis; higher education institutions; interpretability; student success; sustainable education,curriculum; data set; education; higher education; institutional framework; machine learning; teaching,"Vossensteyn J.J., Kottmann A., Jongbloed B.W., Kaiser F., Cremonini L., Stensaker B., Hovdhaugen E., Wollscheid S., Dropout and Completion in Higher Education in Europe: Main Report, (2015); Shapiro D., Dundar A., Wakhungu P., Yuan X., Harrell A., Completing College: A State-Level View of Student Attainment Rates, (2015); Indicators O., Education at a Glance 2016.

It is shown that, in addition to the site-level and course-level indicators commonly used in the literature for prediction, significantly more accurate predictions can be made by introducing so-called chapter-level indicators. These chapter-level indicators are closely linked to the content structure of the subject under study, the hierarchy of its chapters and the learning resources and student activities used in them. Specifically, we make suggestions to the course instructor about the conditions under which there is a hope of obtaining reliable predictions of the student's chances of success or failure. We show how the use of a previously trained model for a newly started similar course requires caution. Even relatively small differences, such as a change in the minimum score to be achieved, a difference in the form of study (full-time or correspondence course), or a difference in the number of compulsory mid-term tests, can cast doubt on the validity of our predictions. We also discuss details of model training that affect the goodness of fit of machine learning models. © 2022 The Authors",Dropout rate; Education; Learning management system; Machine learning models; Prediction; Risk of failure,,"Abu Saa A., Al-Emran M., Shaalan K., Factors affecting students' performance in higher education: A systematic review of predictive data mining techniques, Technology, Knowledge and Learning, 24, pp. 567-598, (2019); Ahmed S.A., Khan S.I., A machine learning approach to predict the engineering students at risk of dropout and factors behind: Bangladesh perspective, 2019 10th international conference on computing, communication and networking technologies (ICCCNT), pp. 1-6, (2019); Alcaraz R., Martinez-Rodrigo A., Zangroniz R., Rieta J.J., Early prediction of students at risk of failing a face-to-face course in power electronic systems, (2021); Aldowah H., Al-Samarraie H., Fauzy W.M., Educational data mining and learning analytics for 21st century higher education: A review and synthesis, Telematics and Informatics, 37, pp. 13-49, (2019); Ali H.A., Mohamed C., Abdelhamid B., El Alami T., Prediction MOOC's for student by using machine learning methods, 2021 XI international Conference on virtual campus (JICV), pp. 1-3, (2021); Alyahyan E., Dustegor D., Predicting academic success in higher education: Literature review and best practices, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 17, 1, pp. 1-21, (2020); Arias Ortiz E., Dehon C., What are the factors of success at university?

This study uses machine learning models over two Chilean universities to predict first-year engineering student dropout over enrolled students, and to analyze the variables that affect the probability of dropout. The results show that instead of combining the datasets into a single dataset, it is better to apply a model per university. Moreover, among the eight machine learning models tested over the datasets, gradient-boosting decision trees reports the best model. Further analyses of the interpretative models show that a higher score in almost any entrance university test decreases the probability of dropout, the most important variable being the mathematical test. One exception is the language test, where a higher score increases the probability of dropout. © 2021 by the authors.

It is an academic issue and carries an unfavorable economic impact. In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to the early detection of students likely to drop out. This paper uses data corresponding to dropout candidates after their first year in the third largest face-to-face university in Europe, with the goal of predicting likely dropout either at the beginning of the course of study or at the end of the first semester. In this prediction, we considered the five major program areas. Different techniques have been used: first, a Feature Selection Process in order to identify the variables more correlated with dropout; then, some Machine Learning Models (Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks) as well as a Logistic Regression. The results show that dropout detection does not work only with enrollment variables, but it improves after the first semester results. Academic performance is always a relevant variable, but there are others, such as the level of preference that the student had over the course that he or she was finally able to study. The success of the techniques depends on the program areas. Machine Learning obtains the best results, but a simple Logistic Regression model can be used as a reasonable baseline. © 2022 by the authors.",Artificial Neural Networks; decision trees; Feature Selection; logistic regression; machine learning; student dropout; Support Vector Machines,,"Education at a Glance 2019: OECD Indicators, (2019); Ortiz-Lozano J.M., Rua-Vieites A., Bilbao-Calabuig P., Casadesus-Fa M., University student retention: Best time and data to identify undergraduate students at risk of dropout, Innov.

Thus, improving student retention has become a top research priority in many HE institutions. This study aims to clarify the knowledge gap between the most effective data mining technique and the most influential factors that affect student retention. Several methods have been used to predict student retention, such as data analytics and machine learning (ML) techniques. The study reviewed and evaluated 10 current publications to increase student retention in HE. Moreover, the study examines the factors influencing student retention and the ML methods used. Additionally, the study discussed algorithms proven to work well and the challenges associated with using them. The study shows that the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), neural network (NN), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms performed the best out of the investigated algorithms when predicting student retention, with performance rates over 78.1%. The study concludes by discussing the limitations of this study and highlighting suggestions for future research directions that can be applied to increase student retention in HE. © 2023 IEEE.",Data mining techniques; Drop out; Higher Education; Machine learning; Student retention,Data Analytics; Data mining; Decision trees; Drops; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Random forests; Students; Support vector machines; Academic achievements; Data-mining techniques; Drop-out; First year; High educations; Literature reviews; Machine-learning; Overall quality; Student retention; Student satisfaction; Adaptive boosting,"Muhammad N., Sellapan P., Waleej H., Impact of Postgraduate Students Dropout and Delay in University: Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms, International Journal of Advanced Trends in Computer Science and Engineering, 10, 3, pp. 1821-1826, (2021); Casanova J.R., Fernandez-Castanon A.C., Perez J.C.N., Almeida L.S., Gutierrez A.B.B., Factors that determine the persistence and dropout of university students, Scopus, (2018); Tinto V., Dropout from Higher Education: A Theoretical Synthesis of Recent Research, Rev Educ Res, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Yadav S.K., Nagar J.P., Surjeet I., Yahoocoin B.B., Professor A., Pal S., Mining Education Data to Predict Student's Retention: A comparative Study, (2012); Kemper L., Vorhoff G., Wigger B.U., Predicting student dropout: A machine learning approach, European Journal of Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 28-47, (2020); Sani N.S., Nafuri A.F.M., Othman Z.A., Nazri M.Z.A., Mohamad K.N., Drop-Out Prediction in Higher Education Among B40 Students, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 11, pp. 550-559, (2020); Yaacob W.F.W., Sobri N.M., Nasir S.A.M., Yaacob W.F.W., Norshahidi N.D., Husin W.Z.W., Predicting Student Drop-Out in Higher Institution Using Data Mining Techniques, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1496, 1, (2020); Palacios C.A., Reyes-Suarez J.A., Bearzotti L.A., Leiva V., Marchant C., Knowledge discovery for higher education student retention based on data mining: Machine learning algorithms and case study in Chile, Entropy, 23, 4, (2021); Realinho V., Machado J., Baptista L., Martins M.V., Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success, Data (Basel), 7, 11, (2022); Segura M., Mello J., Hernandez A., Machine Learning Prediction of University Student Dropout: Does Preference Play a Key Role, Mathematics, 10, 18, (2022); Arqawi S.M., Zitawi E.A., Rabaya A.H., Abunasser B.S., Predicting University Student Retention using Artificial Intelligence; Kitchenham B., Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews; Biolchini J., Mian P.G., Natali A.C.C., Travassos G.H., Systematic Review in Software Engineering, (2005); Embarak O., Towards an Adaptive Education through a Machine Learning Recommendation System, 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication, ICAIIC 2021, pp. 187-192, (2021); Eric J., Applying a Hybrid Sampling and Boosting Approach to Predict Student Retention, Int J Mach Learn Comput, 12, 5, (2022); Da Silva D.E.M., Pires E.J.S., Reis A., De Moura P.B.O., Barroso J., Forecasting Students Dropout: A UTAD University Study, Future Internet, 14, 3, (2022); Brdesee H.S., Alsaggaf W., Aljohani N., Hassan S.-U., Predictive Model Using a Machine Learning Approach for Enhancing the Retention Rate of Students At-Risk, Int J Semant Web Inf Syst, 18, 1, pp. 1-21, (2022)","W.M.

This problem aims to predict early school failure and dropout, and to determine the well-founded analysis of student performance for the improvement of educational quality. This document deals the problem of predicting grades of UNIR university master’s degree students in the on-line mode, proposing a working model and comparing different technologies to determine which one fits best with the available data set. In order to make the predictions, the dataset was submitted to a cleaning and analysis phases, being prepared for the use of Machine Learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Neural Networks. A comparison is made that addresses a double prediction on a homogeneous set of input data, predicting the final grade per subject and the final master’s degree grade. The results were obtained demonstrate that the use of these techniques makes possible the grade predictions.

As soon as student enrolled to the university, they will certainly encounter many difficulties and problems which discourage their motivation towards their courses and which pushes them to leave their university. The aim of our article is to manage an investigation of the issue of dropping out their studies. This investigation actively integrates the benefits ofmachine learning. Hence, we will concentrate on two fundamental strategies which are KNN, which depends on the idea of likeness among data; and the famous strategy SVM, which can break the issues of classification. Thanks to predictive analytics, we can come up concrete solutions to decrease this issue.

Understanding the reasons behind such a high desertion rate can drastically improve the success of students and universities. This work applies existing data mining techniques to predict the academic dropout mainly using the academic grades. Four different machine learning techniques are presented and analyzed. The dataset consists of 331 students who were previously enrolled in the Computer Engineering degree at the Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD). The study aims to detect students who may prematurely drop out using existing methods. The most relevant data features were identified using the Permutation Feature Importance technique. In the second phase, several methods to predict the dropouts were applied. Then, each machine learning technique’s results were displayed and compared to select the best approach to predict academic dropout. The methods used achieved good results, reaching an F1-Score of 81% in the final test set, concluding that students’ marks somehow incorporate their living conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

The functional form of this education differs significantly among institutions, and in recent years active learning that demonstrates a strong impact on students' retention and synthesis of new material has taken hold as the preferred educational methodology. Among active learning strategies, gamified or playful learning has grown in popularity, with substantial evidence indicating that games can increase student participation and social interaction with their classmates and with the subject matter. A key goal of engineering ethics education is for students to learn how to identify, frame, and resolve ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas occur naturally in social situations, in which an individual must reconcile opposing priorities and viewpoints. Thus, it seems natural that as a part of their ethics education, students should discuss contextualized engineering ethical situations with their peers. How these discussions play out, and the manner in which students (particularly first-year engineering students) address and resolve ethical dilemmas in a group setting is the main topic of this research paper. In this study, first-year engineering students from three universities across the northeastern USA participated in group discussions involving engineering ethical scenarios derived from the Engineering Ethics Reasoning Instrument (EERI) and Toxic Workplaces: A Cooperative Ethics Card Game (a game developed by the researchers). Questions were posed to the student groups, which center upon concepts such as integrity, conflicting obligations, and the contextual nature of ethical decision making. An a priori coding schema based on these concepts was applied to analyze the student responses, based upon earlier iterations of this procedure performed in previous years of the study. The primary results from this research aim to provide some insight about first-year engineering students' mindsets when identifying, framing, and resolving ethical dilemmas. This information can inform ethics education design and development strategies. Furthermore, the experimental procedure is designed to provide a curated series of ethical engineering scenarios with accompanying discussion questions that could be adopted in any first-year classroom for instructional and assessment purposes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Disasters; Engineering education; Ethical technology; Learning systems; Engineering ethics; Ethical dilemma; Ethics education; First-year engineering; Functional forms; Group discussions; High impact; Large-scale impacts; Student groups; Undergraduate engineering programs; Students,"Herkert J., Engineering ethics education in the USA: content, pedagogy and curriculum, European Journal of Engineering Education, 25, 4, pp. 303-313, (2000); Infusing ethics into the development of engineers: exemplary education activities and programs, (2016); Hess J.

This has become one of the challenging factors for the educational institution. The students are getting into the institution andembarking their learning with several expectations and dreams. The expectations of the students have not fulfilleddue to various factors such as staff, management, parents, course chosen etc., that make them drop from their registered curriculum. However, this has become the main issue for all educational institutes wherein several researchers introduced the technique of data mining for analysing as well as predicting the student's dropout. Therefore, this paper focuses on early finding of dropout variables as an advance by dimensionality reduction using feature selection and extraction methods. In feature extraction, there may be an occurrence of imbalanceddata that may affect the significance of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Thus, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is subsequently added with Principal Compound Analysis (PCA) whereas the oversampling of imbalanced data is managed to balanced dataset. Moreover, the 1,243 student's data have been collectedand analysed using proposed PCA-SMOTE to allow for a more accurate forecast in case of dropout. Accuracy performance related to PCA-SMOTE has been 97.6% that is evaluated through confusion matrix parameter and compared with existing ML to find out the exact students who are not satisfied with their fulfilment in the environment of education institute. © 2022 IEEE",Dropout student; Education institute; Imbalanced data; imbalanced data; Machine Learning (ML); prediction; Principal Compound Analysis (PCA); Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE),Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Human resource management; Machine learning; Dropout student; Education institute; Educational institutions; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Principal compound analyse; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Synthetic minority oversampling technique; Students,"Bayer J., Bydzovska H., Geryk J., Obsivac T., Popelinsky L., Predictingdrop-out fromsocial behaviour of students, Proc. 5th Int.

Students performance is very crucial in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to improve education systems has led to the development of the field of research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings, allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years. Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure, dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods. The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to explore the relationship between these factors and GPA's. For the classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different machine learning models on predicting student performance at early stages using different features including courses' grades and admission tests' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.  © 2013 IEEE.",data mining; early prediction; Graph mining; student academic performance; students' performance prediction,Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Curricula; Data mining; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quality control; Teaching; Academic performance; Early prediction; Graph mining; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Performance prediction; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Student academic performance; Student performance; Student’ performance prediction; Students,"Giannakas F., Troussas C., Voyiatzis I., Sgouropoulou C., A deep learning classification framework for early prediction of team-based academic performance, Appl.

There is some information available in the literature on the subject worldwide yet centered on undergraduate programs. However, there is limited research on students at the postgraduate level. Researchers from all universities in Chile and worldwide have discussed delayed graduation as it is a critical consideration for all institutional accreditation processes. For this reason, educators and researchers in institutions are interested in offering strategies to reduce the graduation time by analyzing risk factors students face during their training. This study presents an early detection model based on machine learning to account for graduation delays seen at the master's student graduation process. This article presents a descriptive study that examines the relationship between students' characteristics (gender, age, education program, and qualifications) and program characteristics (program duration, program location, and class schedule) with delayed graduation. The analysis takes a sample of students (1257 records) from the last five years who have completed all program credits for their engineering master's degree and have registered in the final project process. Using descriptive analysis, the study documents the factors that play a crucial role in explaining delayed graduation. The risk factor database includes individual student information such as age, gender, and academic information such as course passing rate, faculty, dropout rate, and graduation time. Study results reveal that students who fail the first subject in their master's thesis tend to increase their graduation time considerably. We found factors affecting delayed graduation, including individual characteristics (gender; with low weight-significance), students' backgrounds (education, pass rate; with high weight-significance), and institutional environment (program type/modality of the program, location; with medium weight-significance). Results indicate that it is necessary to support students to improve their performance. Higher education institutions should use this study's results to develop proactive initiatives (student accompaniment and academic staff accompaniment) that might help reduce students' graduation time. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",Delayed graduation; Dropout rate; Higher education; Master's degree; Risk factors,Education computing; Engineering education; Accreditation process; Delayed graduation; Dropout rate; High educations; Institutional accreditation; Master degree; Master students; Post-graduate levels; Risk factors; Undergraduate projects; Students,"Rizzolo S., DeForest A.

Both school dropout and educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on student academic performance and also for training in the machine learning area. © 2022 by the authors.",academic performance; educational data mining; imbalanced classes; learning management system; machine learning in education; multi-class classification; prediction,Data mining; Economics; Education computing; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Machine learning; Risk perception; Academic performance; Educational data mining; High educations; Higher education institutions; Imbalanced class; Information monitoring; Learning management system; Machine learning in education; Machine-learning; Multi-class classification; Students,"Behr A., Giese M., Teguim Kamdjou H.D., Theune K., Motives for Dropping out from Higher Education—An Analysis of Bachelor’s Degree Students in Germany, Eur.

Most of the research in the educational field centers on demonstrating the student’s potential rather than focusing on faculty quality. This paper proposed a model, which is the fusion of stacking and voting ensemble, to evaluate faculty performance. We have considered two datasets; one is taken from the UCI machine learning repository (Teaching Assistant Evaluation) and another is collected from the students of a university. We have applied fifteen classification algorithms- K Nearest neighbors, Extra Tree, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, CatBoost Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Ridge Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, Ada Boost Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, SVM—Linear Kernel, Naive Bayes, and proposed model using the python programming language. It is observed that the proposed model is giving 2% higher accuracy than results present in the literature on the teaching assistant evaluation dataset. The variable importance is also computed on the collected feedback, which gives the factors playing important roles in faculty performance. The analysis shows that the ability of faculty to link contents with real-life examples, faculty encouraged student's participation in class discussion, and faculty ability to inspire students to learn the course plays important roles in the performance of faculty. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.",Classification algorithms; EDM (Educational Data Mining); Faculty performance evaluation; Stacking; Voting ensemble,,"Baker R.S., Yacef K., The state of educational data mining in 2009: a review and future visions, J Educ Data Min, 1, 1, pp. 3-17, (2009); Rahman L., Setiawan N.A., Permanasari A.E., Feature selection methods in improving the accuracy of classifying students' academic performance, 2017 2Nd International Conferences on Information Technology, Information Systems and Electrical Engineering (ICITISEE), IEEE, pp. 267-271, (2017); Delavari N., Phon-Amnuaisuk S., Beikzadeh M.R., Data mining application in higher learning institutions, Inform Educ Int J, (2008); Kumar V., Anupama C., An empirical study of the applications of data mining techniques in higher education, Int J Adv Comput Sci Appl, (2011); Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data mining: concepts and techniques, pp. 978-981, (2012); Sojka J., Gupta A.K., Deeter-Schmelz D.R., Student and faculty perceptions of student evaluations of teaching: a study of similarities and differences, Coll Teach, 50, 2, pp. 44-49, (2002); Sarala V., Krishnaiah J., Empirical study of data mining techniques in the education system, Int J Adv Comput Sci Technol (IJACST), 4, 1, pp. 15-21, (2015); Radmacher S.A., Martin D.J., Identifying significant predictors of student evaluations of faculty through hierarchical regression analysis, J Psychol, 135, 3, pp. 259-268, (2001); Hobson S.M., Talbot D.M., Understanding student evaluations: what all faculty should know, Coll Teach, 49, 1, pp. 26-31, (2001); Ayub M., Hapnes T., Maresha CW, and Steven Y (2017) Modelling online assessment in management subjects through educational data mining, 2017 International Conference on Data and Software Engineering, pp. 1-6; Coburn L., Student Evaluation of Teacher Performance, ERIC/TME Update Series, (1984); Radmacher S.A., Martin D.J., ‘Identifying significant predictors of student evaluations of faculty through hierarchical regression analysis’, J Psychol, 135, 3, pp. 259-269, (2001); Crumbley D.L., Fliedner E., ‘Accounting administrators’ perceptions of student evaluation of teaching (SET) information’, Qual Assur Educ, 10, 4, pp. 213-222, (2002); Liaw S.-H., Goh K.-L., Evidence and control of biases in student evaluations of teaching, Int J Educ Manag, 17, 1, pp. 37-43, (2003); Roy S., Shailendra N.S., Emerging trends in applications of big data in educational data mining and learning analytics, 2017 7Th International Conference on Cloud Computing, pp. 193-198, (2017); Baradwaj B.K., Pal S., Mining Educational Data to Analyze students’ Performance., (2012); Zaffar M., Manzoor A.H., Savita KS (2017) Performance analysis of feature selection algorithm for educational data mining, 2017 IEEE Conference on Big Data and Analytics, pp. 7-12; Ogunde A.O., Ajibade D.A., A data mining system for predicting university students’ graduation grades using the ID3 decision tree algorithm, J Comput Sci Inf Technol, 2, 1, pp. 21-46, (2014); Guleria P., Manish A., Manu S., Increasing quality of education using educational data mining.

In Latin America, 50% of students drop out, and only 50% of the remaining ones graduate on time. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify students at risk and understand the main factors of dropping out. Together with the emergence of efficient computational methods, the rich data accumulated in educational administrative systems have opened novel approaches to promote student persistence. In order to support research related to preventing student dropout, a dataset has been gathered and curated from Tecnologico de Monterrey students, consisting of 50 variables and 143,326 records. The dataset contains non-identifiable information of 121,584 High School and Undergraduate students belonging to the seven admission cohorts from August–December 2014 to 2020, covering two educational models. The variables included in this dataset consider factors mentioned in the literature, such as sociodemographic and academic information related to the student, as well as institution-specific variables, such as student life. This dataset provides researchers with the opportunity to test different types of models for dropout prediction, so as to inform timely interventions to support at-risk students.

Both literature on the subjects and the results that emerged from numerous specific investigations into the dropouts of the university system, showed the crucial importance of this junction between the first and the second year. Reasons for dropping out can be quite varied, ranging from incorrect and/or insufficient prospective student orientation, the willingness or need to find a job as quickly as possible, to a lack of awareness of not being able to cope with a particular course of study rather than another. In this paper we focus specifically on the problem of dropouts in Italy, addressing it from a dual point of view. At an aggregate level, the analysis deals with dropout rates in Italy between the first and second year, in order to identify the main trends and dynamics at the national level. Subsequently, we analyze individual-level data from the University of Bari Aldo Moro, aiming to identify the most important contributing factors. This individual-level approach has emerged over recent years, and is generally known as ‘Educational Data Mining’, focused on the development of ad hoc methods that can be used to discover regularities and new information within databases from contexts related to education. Using supervised classification methods, we are able to identify retrospectively the profile of students who are most likely to dropout. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Data science; Dropout rates; Machine learning; University careers,Italy; data mining; employment; higher education; machine learning; statistical analysis; student; university sector,"Araque F., Roldan C., Salguero A., Factors influencing university drop out rates, Computers & Education, 53, 3, pp. 563-574, (2009); Baker R., Yacef K., The state of educational data mining in 2009: A review and future visions, Journal of Educational Data Mining, 1, 1, pp. 3-17, (2009); Belloc F., Maruotti A., Petrella L., University drop-out: An Italian experience, Higher Education, 60, 2, pp. 127-138, (2010); Belloc F., Maruotti A., Petrella L., How individual characteristics affect university students drop-out: A semiparametric mixed-effects model for an Italian case study, Journal of Applied Statistics, 38, 10, pp. 2225-2239, (2011); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breiman L., Friedman J., Olshen R., Stone C., Classification and regression trees, (1984); Burgalassi M., Biasi V., Capobianco R., Moretti G., The phenomenon of early college leavers.

Depression, stress, anxiety, brain, heart, and liver disorders, unhappiness, loss of excellent health, and financial troubles are just a few of the major challenges that can arise as a result of alcohol abuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be used to diagnose alcoholism in a straightforward manner. The EEG readings indicate the electrical activities of the brain. It is tough to understand them because they are random in nature, but they hold the most important information regarding the brain’s state. Because of the complexity of EEG signals, accurately classifying alcoholism with only a short dataset is difficult. Artificial neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), give efficient and accurate solutions in a number of pattern-based categorization applications. The EEG dataset from the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning (UCI-ML) was used. We were able to obtain 98% average accuracy using CNN on raw EEG data by improving a baseline CNN model and exceeding it in a variety of performance evaluation parameters. Dropout, batch normalisation, and kernel regularisation processes were used to improve the baseline model, as well as a comparison of the two models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Alcoholism; CNN; EEG,Biomedical signal processing; Brain; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Electrophysiology; Alcohol abuse; Alcoholism; Brain disorders; Convolutional neural network; Electrical activities; Liver disorder; Machine-learning; S state; Stress disorders; University of California; Electroencephalography,"Schuckit M.A., Recognition & management of withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens), N Engl J Med, 371, 22, pp. 2109-2113, (2014); Boden M.A., Mind as Machine: A History of Cognitive Science, (2008); Saminu S., Xu G., Shuai Z., Abd El Kader I., Jabire A.H., Ahmed Y.K., Karaye I.A., Ahmad I.S., A recent investigation on detection and classification of epileptic seizure techniques using EEG signal, Brain Sci, 11, (2021); Orosco L., Correa A.G., Laciar E., A survey of performance and techniques for automatic epilepsy detection, J Med Biol Eng, 33, pp. 526-537, (2013); Craik A., He Y., Contreras-Vidal J.L., Deep learning for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification tasks: A review, J Neural Eng, 16, (2019); Anuragi A., Sisodia D.S., Alcohol use disorder detection using EEG signal features and flexible analytical wavelet transform, Biomed Signal Process Control, 52, pp. 384-393, (2019); Zhu G., Li Y., Wen P.P., Wang S., Analysis of alcoholic EEG signals based on horizontal visibility graph entropy, Brain Inform, 1, pp. 19-25, (2014); Shri T.P., Sriraam N., Pattern recognition of spectral entropy features for detection of alcoholic and control visual ERP’s in multichannel EEGs, Brain Inform, 4, pp. 147-158, (2017); Acharya J.N., Hani A.J., Cheek J., Thirumala P., Tsuchida T.N., American clinical neurophysi-ology society guideline 2: Guidelines for standard electrode position nomenclature, Neurodiagn J, 56, pp. 245-252, (2016); Siuly S., Bajaj V., Sengur A., Zhang Y., An advanced analysis system for identifying alcoholic brain state through EEG signals, Int J Autom Comput, 16, pp. 737-747, (2019); Ren W., Han M., Classification of EEG signals using hybrid feature extraction and ensemble extreme learning machine, Neural Process Lett, 50, pp. 1281-1301, (2019); Rahman S., Sharma T., Mahmud M., Improving alcoholism diagnosis: Comparing instance-based classifiers against neural networks for classifying EEG signal, Proceedings of the International Conference on Brain Informatics, Padova, Italy, 18–20 Sept, 2020, pp. 239-250, (2020); Abbas W., Khan N.A., DeepMI: Deep learning for multiclass motor imagery classification, Proceedings of the 2018 40Th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 219-222, (2018); Wei X., Zhou L., Chen Z., Zhang L., Zhou Y., Automatic seizure detection using three-dimensional CNN based on multi-channel EEG, BMC Med Inform Decis Mak, 18, pp. 71-80, (2018); Roy Y., Banville H., Albuquerque I., Gramfort A., Falk T.H., Faubert J., Deep learning-based electroencephalography analysis: A systematic review.

It was developed in Python and the free software Weka. For this, the data of the students who entered the faculty from 2004 to 2014 have been considered. This solution increases the availability and the level of satisfaction of the faculty; in the learning process, an accuracy percentage of 90.34% and precision of 95.91% was obtained, so the data mining model is considered valid. In addition, it was found that the variables that most influenced students in making the decision to abandon their studies are the historical weighted average their grades, the weighted average their grades of the last cycle, and the number of credits of their approved courses © 2022.

However, a growing body of evidence shows that these algorithms may not serve underprivileged communities well and at times discriminate against them. This is all the more concerning in education as negative outcomes have long-term implications. We propose a systematic process for framing, detecting, documenting, and reporting unfairness risks. The systematic approach's outcomes are merged into a framework named FairEd, which would help decision-makers to understand unfairness risks along the environmental and analytical fairness dimension. The tool allows to decide (i) whether the dataset contains risks of unfairness; (ii) how the models could perform along many fairness dimensions; (iii) whether potentially unfair outcomes can be mitigated without degrading performance. The systematic approach is applied to a Chilean University case study, where a predicting student dropout model is aimed to build. First, we capture the nuances of the Chilean context where unfairness emerges along income lines and demographic groups. Second, we highlight the benefit of reporting unfairness risks along a diverse set of metrics to shed light on potential discrimination. Third, we find that measuring the cost of fairness is an important quantity to report on when doing the model selection.  © 2022 ACM.",algorithmic fairness; educational data mining; student dropout,Data mining;

Identifying students at risk of dropping out allows timely taking measures for their retention. The paper presents the results of a study conducted among students of engineering programs at Trakia University - Stara Zagora. The collected data are subjected to processing, which aims to find the most important attributes that determine the risk of dropping out of university. The processing is done with Weka open source software. Different algorithms for selecting attributes with different search methods are applied. The most appropriate attribute selection algorithm was selected after applying the BayesNet classifier to the results obtained. The indicators TP rate, Precision and F-measure were compared. When applying InfoGainAttributeEval, the highest results are obtained for the accuracy of the classification. At the next stage, it is planned to expand the study among a larger number of students from different programs and create an effective forecasting model.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,"Education at a Glance 2019: OECD Indicators, (2019); Vossensteyn H, Kottmann A, Jongbloed B, Kaiser F, Cremonini L, Stensaker B, Hovdhaugen E, Wollscheid S, Dropout and Completion in Higher Education in Europe: Main Report, (2015); Kabakchieva D, Predicting Student Performance by Using Data Mining Methods for Classification Cybernetics and information technologies, 13, pp. 61-72, (2013); Martinho V, Nunes C, Roberto C, Proc.

In an approach based on machine learning algorithms to detect students at risk of dropout, there are three main factors: the choice of features likely to influence a partial or total stop of the student, the choice of the algorithm to implement a prediction model, and the choice of the evaluation metrics to monitor and assess the credibility of the results. This paper aims to provide a diagnosis of machine learning techniques used to detect students’ dropout in higher education programs, a critical analysis of the limitations of the models proposed in the literature, as well as the major contribution of this article is to present recommendations that may resolve the lack of global model that can be generalized in all the higher education institutions at least in the same country or in the same university. © 2022,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

All colleges and universities are essentially focused on improving management decision-making and educating pupils. High-quality higher education can be obtained through a variety of methods. One method is to accurately forecast pupils' achievement in their chosen educational context. There are numerous prediction models from which to pick. While it is unclear whether there are any markers that can predict whether a kid will be an academic genius, a dropout, or an average performer, the researcher reports student achievement. This article presents a metaheuristics and machine learning-based method for the classification and prediction of student performance. Firstly, features are selected using a relief algorithm. Machine learning classifiers such as BPNN, RF, and NB are used to classify student academic performance data. BPNN is having better accuracy for classification and prediction of student academic performance.  © 2022 Mustafa Kamal et al.",,Classification (of information); Decision making; Deterioration; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Machine learning; Academic performance; Colleges and universities; Educational context; High educations; High quality; Machine-learning; Management decision-making; Meta-heuristic methods; Research and development; Student performance; Students,"Tomasevic N., Gvozdenovic N., Vranes S., An overview and comparison of supervised data mining techniques for student exam performance prediction, Computer Education'', 143, (2020); Li F., Li F.W.B., Study on student performance estimation, student progress analysis, and student potential prediction based on data mining, Computers & Education, 123, pp. 97-108, (2018); Raghuvanshi A., Singhsingh U.K., Sajjasajja G.S., Pallathadka H., Asenso E., Kamal M., Singh K., Phasinam K., Intrusion detection using machine learning for risk mitigation in IoT-enabled smart irrigation in smart farming, Journal of Food Quality, 2022, pp. 1-8, (2022); Kim B.-H., Vizitei E., Ganapathi V., GritNet: Student Performance Prediction with Deep Learning, 1804, (2018); Gupta A., Koul N., SWAN: A Swarm Intelligence Based Framework for Network Management of IP Networks, pp. 114-118; Raghuvanshi A., Singhsingh U.K., Joshi C., A review of various security and privacy innovations for IoT applications in healthcare, Advanced Healthcare Systems, 9, pp. 43-58, (2022); Kapoor L., Bawa S., Gupta A., Hierarchical Chord-Based Resource Discovery in Intercloud Environment, pp. 464-469; Jayasingh B.B., Kumar H., Aishwarya G., Inquiry Based Inductive Learning Practices in Engineering Education: A Classroom Study, pp. 60-65; Sharabiani A., Karim F., Sharabiani A., Atanasov M., Darabi H., An Enhanced Bayesian Network Model for Prediction of Students' Academic Performance in Engineering Programs, pp. 832-837; Bekele R., Menzel W., A Bayesian approach to predict performance of a student (BAPPS): A Case with Ethiopian Students, Journal of Information Science, 22, 23, pp. 24-30, (2005); Bharadwaj B.K., Kumar Yadav S., Pal S., Data mining applications: A comparative study for predicting student's performance, International Journal of Innovative Technology & Creative Engineering, 1, 12, pp. 13-19, (2012); Hemaid R.K., Halees A.M.E., Improving teacher performance using data mining, Ijarcce, 4, 2, pp. 407-412, (2015); Lokhande M.P., Patil D.D., Patil L.V., Shabaz M., Machine-to-Machine communication for device identification and classification in secure telerobotics surgery, Security and Communication Networks, 2021, pp. 1-16, (2021); Bharadwaj B.K., Pal S., Mining educational data to analyze students, performance, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2, 6, pp. 63-69, (2011); Yao Q., Shabaz M., Lohani T.K., Wasim Bhatt M., Panesar G.S., Singh R.K., 3D modelling and visualization for vision-based vibration signal processing and measurement, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 30, ISSUE 1, pp. 541-553, (2021); Rossi P., Learning environment with artificial intelligence elements, Journal of E-Learning and Knowledge Society, 5, NO. 1, pp. 67-75, (2009); Agaoglu M., Yurtkoru E.S., Ekmekci A.K., The effect of ERP implementation CSFs on business performance: An empirical study on users' perception, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 210, pp. 35-42, (2015); Kira K., Rendell L.A., Feature Selection Problem: Traditional Methods and A New Algorithm, pp. 129-134; Thakur D., Singh J., Dhiman G., Shabaz M., Gera T., Identifying major research areas and minor research themes of android malware analysis and detection field using LSA, Complexity, 2021, pp. 1-28, (2021); Haq M.A., Baral P., Yaragal S., Pradhan B., Bulk processing of multi-temporal modis data, statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to understand climate variables in the Indian himalayan region, Sensors, 21, 21, (2021)","A.W.

There are several mechanisms that are involved in typical student activities that handle a large amount of data gathered via software programs for technology-enhanced learning that are aided by automation. We can therefore learn suitable information about their knowledge and their connection to academic activities by properly reviewing and analyzing this data. This data is used to feed promising algorithms and approaches that can predict students’ success. In addition to the objectives that must be met in this field, this research will reveal numerous contemporary methodologies that are widely used for predicting performance such as machine learning. The study’s mission is to implement and compare existing approaches to come up with an optimized solution and an accurate model to predict the performance as well. The regression task involved modeling the fundamental classes. Additionally, different selections (such as with and without prior grades) and DM models were investigated. The findings demonstrate that, given access to grades from the first and/or second school periods, high predictive accuracy can be attained. Although prior ratings have a significant impact on student progress, other factors (such as the frequency of absences, the employment and educational status of parents, and alcohol use) have also been found to be significant, and better tools can be developed, which will improve the administration of school resources as well as the standard of instruction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Decision trees; Deep learning; Machine learning in education; Random forest; Regression; XGBoost,Deep learning; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Random forests; Students; Deep learning; Grade predictions; Machine learning in education; Machine-learning; Performance; Random forests; Real- time; Regression; Student performance; Xgboost; Decision trees,"Abu Zohair L.M., Prediction of student’s performance by modelling small dataset size, Int J Educ Technol High Educ, 16, (2019); Bujang S.D.A., Et al., Multiclass prediction model for student grade prediction using ML, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 95608-95621, (2021); Patil A.P., Ganesan K., Kanavalli A., Effective deep learning model to predict student grade point averages, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research (ICCIC), pp. 1-6, (2017); Ramesh V., Parkavi P., Ramar K., Predicting student performance: a statistical and data mining approach, Int J Comput Appl, 63, 8, pp. 35-39, (2013); Cortez P., Silva A.M.G., Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance, Proceedings of 5Th Annual Future Business Technology Conference, pp. 5-12, (2008); Gull H., Saqib M., Iqbal S.Z., Saeed S., Improving learning experience of students by early prediction of student performance using ML, IEEE International Conference for Innovation in Technology (INOCON), pp. 1-4, (2020); Sweeney M., Lester J., Rangwala H., Next-term student grade prediction, IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 970-975, (2015); Ceyhan M., Okyay S., Kartal Y., Adar N., The prediction of student grades using collaborative filtering in a course recommender system, 2021 5Th International Symposium on Multidisciplinary Studies and Innovative Technologies (ISMSIT), pp. 177-181, (2021); Nabil A., Seyam M., Abou-Elfetouh A., Prediction of students’ academic performance based on courses’ grades using deep NNs, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 140731-140746, (2021); Li H., Li W., Zhang X., Yuan H., Wan Y., Machine learning analysis and inference of student performance and visualization of data results based on a small dataset of student information.

However, as yet AI based tools have not been widely adopted in higher education. As a result there is a lack of sound evidence available on the pedagogical impact of AI for learning and teaching. This conceptual paper thus seeks to bridge the gap and addresses the following question: is artificial intelligence really the new big thing that will revolutionise learning and teaching in higher education? Adopting the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical foundations, we argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, at least in their current state of development, do not afford any real new advances for pedagogy in higher education. This is mainly because there does not seem to be valid evidence as to how the use of AI technologies and applications has helped students improve learning, and/or helped tutors make effective pedagogical changes. In addition, the pedagogical affordances of AI have not yet been clearly defined. The challenges that the higher education sector is currently experiencing relating to AI adoption are discussed at three hierarchical levels, namely national, institutional and personal levels. The paper ends with recommendations with regard to accelerating AI use in universities. This includes developing dedicated AI adoption strategies at the institutional level, updating the existing technology infrastructure and up-skilling academic tutors for AI. Practitioner Notes 1. AI technologies have been adopted more widely in industry, Higher education sector globally is lagging behind this trend. 2. Even though the perceived benefits of AI in education have been reported repeatedly, the actual usage is low. 3. The current adoption of AI in higher education is mainly seen in the following areas: automated learning and information support; automated essay scoring; student dropout prediction and personalised learning. 4. AI has the potential to enhance learning and teaching in higher education, however, the barriers and challenges at the national, institutional and personal levels need to be dealt with promptly and appropriately. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

Traditional fault diagnosis methods involve preprocessing of the vibration signals and manual feature extraction. This requires domain expertise and experience in extracting relevant features to accurately detect the fault. Hence, it is of great significance to implement an intelligent fault diagnosis method that involves appropriate automatic feature learning and fault identification. Recent research has shown that deep learning is an effective technique for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a hybrid model based on 1D-CNN (One-Dimensional Convolution Neural Networks) with Bi-LSTM (Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory) is proposed to classify 12 different fault types. Firstly, vibration signals are given as input to 1D-CNN to extract intrinsic features from the input signals. Then, the extracted features are fed into a Bi-LSTM model to identify the faults. The performance of the proposed method is enhanced by applying Softsign activation function in the Bi-LSTM layer and Spatial Dropout in the neural network. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing data is considered for experimentation. The results demonstrated that the proposed model has attained an accuracy of 99.84% in classifying the various faults. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by comparing the predictive accuracy of the proposed method with the existing fault diagnosis methods. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Predicting and analyzing the overall performance of the scholar is imperative to aid educators in figuring out weaknesses and bettering academic scores. However, accomplishing correct predictions is challenging due to the large quantity of instructional data. The important purpose in the back of this is the lack of research on exploring one-of-a-kind prediction strategies and key attributes that have an impact on the student's academic performance. This study found that the computer classification device mastery algorithm was most commonly used to predict student learning success. Four algorithms that have been used more frequently to predict learning about student success are ANN, naive boys, regression of logistics, SVM and decision tree. Meanwhile, the records used in these research papers mainly ranked students' success in the master's in two or three classes that are pass/fail; or fail/pass/excellent. The results of this research will give recommendations and contributions to policy makers and the higher education institutions in Somalia. © 2023 IEEE.",analysis an undergraduate student's performance; machine learning algorithm; student patterns; student profiling,Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Analyse an undergraduate student performance; Education institutions; Machine learning algorithms; Performance patterns; Predicting and analyzing; Student pattern; Student performance; Student profiling; Student success; Undergraduate students; Students,"Aljohani O., A comprehensive review of the major studies and theoretical models of student retention in higher education, High.

To analyze this behavior, this study makes a critical analysis of the topic of interest and aims to review, analyze and summarize the latest research advances related to the prediction of academic performance. The systematic literature review method is applied to answer three questions: (1) What factors are determinants in predicting students' academic performance? (2) what methods are used to predict students' academic performance? and (3) what are the objectives and interests in predicting students' academic performance? After conducting the study of 50 outstanding articles, as results, we found that academic factor is the guideline for predicting academic performance; supervised machine learning is the most used technique, highlighting support vector machine, random forests, and neural networks; the most outstanding objectives for the application of prediction were: Student performance with 53%, risk of failure with 14%, search for student knowledge with 12%, avoid dropout with 12%, and decision making with 10% © 2022 Percy De-La-Cruz, Rommel Rojas-Coaquira, Hugo Vega-Huerta, José Pérez-Quintanilla and Manuel Lagos-Barzola.This open-access article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 license",Academic performance prediction academic performance of students; Machine learning; Predictive models; Systematic review of literature,,"Anvesh K., Srilatha M., Raghunadha Reddy T., Gopi Chand M., Jyothi G.

A large number of university students, particularly in science background disciplines, are enrolled in a variety of undergraduate courses. Nevertheless, the perfection rate is poor. In general, students drop out for a variety of reasons, including academic, family, personal, and political concerns. The main focus of this study is to predict the risk of semester dropout in Bangladesh so that the massive dropout can be stopped. In this research, the current student information is preprocessed to discover the major reason as well as students whoever at the threat of semester dropout will help to grow a new structure in the area of higher education. To predict the dropout risk, random forest and logistic regression were practiced for obtaining the detection model.  © 2021 IEEE.",data mining; data science; dropout prediction; logistic regression; Machine learning; random forest,Data Science; Decision trees; Education computing; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Bangladesh; Detection models; Drop-out; Higher education; Science background; Undergraduate Courses; University students; Students,"Perez B., Castellanos C., Correal D., Applying data mining techniques to predict student dropout: A case study, 2018 Ieee 1st Colombian Conference on Applications in Computational Intelligence (Colcaci), pp. 1-6, (2018); Arif A.S., Islam K.S., A machine learning approach to predict the engineering students at risk of dropout and factors behind: Bangladesh perspective, 2019 10th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT), pp. 1-6, (2019); Fawcett T., An introduction to roc analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, pp. 861-874, (2006); Sivakumar S., Venkataraman S., Selvaraj R., Predictive modeling of student dropout indicators in educational data mining using improved decision tree, Indian Journal of Science and Technology, 9, pp. 1-5, (2016); Nagy M., Molontay R., Predicting dropout in higher education based on secondary school performance, 2018 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Intelligent Engineering Systems (INES), pp. 000389-000394, (2018); Srihar S.N., Multiclass Logistic Regression, pp. 8-10, (2015); Pandas; Brownlee J., Machine Learning Mastery, (2020); Bekkar M., Djemaa H.K., Alitouche T.A., Evaluation measures, J Inf Eng Appl, 3, 10, (2013); Miller D., Nicholson L., Dayoub F., Niko, Dropout sampling for robust object detection in open-set conditions, 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 3243-3249, (2018); Dharmawan T., Ginardi H., Munif A., Dropout detection using non-academic data, 2018 4th International Conference on Science and Technology (ICST), pp. 1-4, (2018); Burgos C., De La D., Lara J.A., Lizcano D., Mart, Data mining for modeling students' performance: A tutoring action plan to prevent academic dropout, Computers \& Electrical Engineering, 66, pp. 541-556, (2018); Kaur P., Singh M., Josan G.S., Classification and prediction based data mining algorithms to predict slow learners in education sector, Procedia Computer Science, 57, pp. 501-509, (2015); Ktoridou D., Measuring the Compatibility between Engineering Students ' Personality Types and Major of Study : A First Step towards Preventing Engineering Education Dropouts, pp. 192-195, (2014); Halawa S., Greene D., Dropout prediction in moocs using learner activity features, Proceedings of the Second European MOOC Stakeholder Summit, 37, 1, pp. 58-65, (2014); Sukhbaatar O., Kohichi O., Tsuyoshi, Dropouts: A case study in blended learning course, TENCON 2018-2018 IEEE Region 10 Conference IEEE, pp. 2205-2210, (2018); Hegde V., Prageeth P.P., Higher education student dropout prediction and analysis through educational data mining, 2018 2nd International Conference on Inventive Systems and Control (ICISC), pp. 694-699, (2018); Gowda K.A., Manjunath A.S., Jayaram M.A., Comparative study of attribute selection using gain ratio and correlation based feature selection, International Journal of Information Technology and Knowledge Management, 2, pp. 271-277, (2010); Heaton J., Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville : Deep Learning, (2017)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113419057,,

The motion-tracking data that is intrinsic to immersive VR applications is rich and can be used to improve learning beyond standard training interfaces. In this paper, we present machine learning (ML) classifiers that predict outcomes from a VR training application. Our approach makes use of the data from the tracked head-mounted display (HMD) and handheld controllers during VR training to predict whether a user will exhibit high or low knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and performance retention. We evaluated six different sets of input features and found varying degrees of accuracy depending on the predicted outcome. By visualizing the tracking data, we determined that users with higher acquisition and retention outcomes made movements with more certainty and with greater velocities than users with lower outcomes. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to develop VR training applications that dynamically adapt to a user by using commonly available tracking data to predict learning and retention outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

For this, data from a total of 258,440 students were used to generate automated models to predict students at risk of failure or dropping out. Data were collected from primary and secondary education from different sources and for the period between 2015 and 2020. Such data contains demographic information about the students and their trajectories from the first grade of primary school to the second grade of secondary school (e.g., student assessments in different subjects over the years, the amount of absences, participation in social welfare programs, and the zone of the school, among other factors). Predictive models using the random forest algorithm were trained, and their performances were evaluated with F1-Macro and AUROC measures. The models were planned to be applied in different periods of the school year for the regular secondary school and for the technical secondary school ((before the beginning of the school year and after the first evaluation meeting for each grade). A total of eight predictive models were developed considering this temporal approach, and after an analysis of bias considering three protected attributes (gender, school zone, and social welfare program participation), seven of them were approved to be used for prediction. The models achieved outstanding performances according to the literature, with an AUROC higher than 0.90 and F1-Macro higher than 0.88. This paper describes in depth the characteristics of the data gathered, the specifics of data preprocessing, and the methodology followed for model generation and bias analysis, together with the architecture developed for the deployment of the predictive models. Among other findings, the results of the paper corroborate the importance given in the literature of using the previous performances of the students in order to predict their future performances. © 2022 by the authors.",at-risk prediction; bias analysis; classification; dropout prediction; educational strategies; fairness in machine learning; learning analytics; secondary education,Decision trees; Education computing; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Random forests; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; At-risk prediction; Bias analyse; Dropout prediction; Educational strategy; Fairness in machine learning; Learning analytic; Machine-learning; Risk predictions; Secondary education; Secondary schools; Students,"Santin D., Sicilia G., Measuring the efficiency of public schools in Uruguay: Main drivers and policy implications, Lat.

While early identification of at-risk students allows timely planning and implementation of measures to prevent adverse outcomes, there is a trade-off between the predictive model's performance and the prediction window size, or model performance and its actionability. In this study, we used a dataset of 83,596 unique Portuguese students in grades 5th to 9th to predict retention at or before the end of 9th grade. We explored how different prediction window sizes impact the predictive model's performance, the feature importance, and the models' bias. The models with the shorter prediction window performed better in terms of precision, but the model with the largest prediction window showed a higher lift over the existing rule-based model. Prediction window size impacted the importance of demographic features and model's fairness. Our results contribute to the extant discussion on predicting retention, by adding empirical evidence about the models' added value in performance versus the existing practice, suggesting types of data to collect and use, and discussing education-specific challenges of responsible data science.  © 2022 IEEE.",feature importance; model bias; model performance; prediction window; school retention,Economic and social effects; Education computing; Risk assessment; Students; Actionability; Feature importance; Model bias; Modeling performance; Performance; Prediction window; Predictive models; School retention; Trade off; Window Size; Forecasting,"Nunes L.C., Balcao Reis A., Seabra C., Is retention beneficial to low-Achieving students?

We propose an academic and emotional tracking model that uses data mining and machine learning to group university students according to their level of dropout risk. We worked with 670 students from a Peruvian public university, applied 5 valid and reliable psychological assessment questionnaires to them using a chatbot-based system, and then classified them using 3 density-based unsupervised learning algorithms, DBSCAN, K-Means, and HDBSCAN. The results showed that HDBSCAN was the most robust option, obtaining better validity levels in two of the three internal indices evaluated, where the performance of the Silhouette index was 0.6823, the performance of the Davies–Bouldin index was 0.6563, and the performance of the Calinski–Harabasz index was 369.6459. The best number of clusters produced by the internal indices was five. For the validation of external indices, with answers from mental health professionals, we obtained a high level of precision in the F-measure: 90.9%, purity: 94.5%, V-measure: 86.9%, and ARI: 86.5%, and this indicates the robustness of the proposed model that allows us to categorize university students into five levels according to the risk of dropping out. © 2022 by the authors.",clustering; data mining; DBSCAN; HDBSCAN; K-Means,Data mining; Education computing; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Risk assessment; Unsupervised learning; Clusterings; College students; DBSCAN; Density-based; HDBSCAN; K-means; Performance; Risk levels; University students; Unsupervised learning algorithms; Students,"Diaz-Mendez M., Paredes M.R., Saren M., Improving Society by Improving Education through Service-Dominant Logic: Reframing the Role of Students in Higher Education, Sustainability, 11, (2019); Zarouk M.Y., Olivera E., Peres P., Khaldi M., The Impact of Flipped Project-Based Learning on Self-Regulation in Higher Education, Int.

In particular, chatbots can be used to support citizens living in sparsely populated areas who face problems such as poor access to mental health services, lack of 24/7 support, barriers to engagement, lack of age appropriate support and reductions in health budgets. The aim of this study was to establish if user groups can design content for a chatbot to support the mental wellbeing of individuals in rural areas. University students and staff, mental health professionals and mental health service users (N = 78 total) were recruited to workshops across Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, Finland and Sweden. The findings revealed that participants wanted a positive chatbot that was able to listen, support, inform and build a rapport with users. Gamification could be used within the chatbot to increase user engagement and retention. Content within the chatbot could include validated mental health scales and appropriate response triggers, such as signposting to external resources should the user disclose potentially harmful information or suicidal intent. Overall, the workshop participants identified user needs which can be transformed into chatbot requirements. Responsible design of mental healthcare chatbots should consider what users want or need, but also what chatbot features artificial intelligence can competently facilitate and which features mental health professionals would endorse. © 2021, The Author(s).",Co-creation;

Our research focuses on predicting early dropout to provide school administrators with warnings about at-risk students. This enables schools to offer appropriate solutions and support. This research explores the influence of academic performance on student dropout. We evaluated the proposed method on a dataset using comprehensive information about students, subjects, and academic performance. By extracting features and grouping them based on similar characteristics, we summarized critical information from the raw database. The problem is divided into two phases: English preparation terms and Main terms, aligning with the university's program structure. However, the data on dropout status is imbalanced, and numerous essential values are missing. To address this, we employed three deep learning models: the convolution-based model (CNN), the graph convolution network-based model (GCN), and the tabular learning model (TabNet). We compared the performance of these deep learning models with traditional machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) with feature selection. Our deep learning models outperformed tree-based algorithms, achieving a balanced accuracy of 72% in the English preparation phase and 75% in primary terms. It is worth noting that TabNet prioritizes recall at the expense of precision, while CNN and GCN models yield more balanced results. © 2023 IEEE.",Academic performance; convolutional network; Deep learning; Dropout prediction; Feature selection; Graph Convolution network; Imbalance; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Tabular learning,Adaptive boosting; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Education computing; Feature Selection; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Students; Support vector machines; Academic performance; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Dropout prediction; Features selection; Graph convolution network; Imbalance; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Tabular learning; Convolution,"Curtis J., Others A., Dropout Prediction, (1983); Kotsiantis S.B., Pierrakeas C.J., Pintelas P.E., Preventing Student Dropout in Distance Learning Using Machine Learning Techniques, Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, 2774, pp. 267-274, (2003); Al-Radaideh Q., Al-Shawakfa E., Al-Najjar M., Mining Student Data Using Decision Trees, Int.

Despite recent advances with educators incorporating games and gaming strategies into higher-learning curricula, there is a current void in the literature that clarifies the critical relationship between GBL implementations and learning outcomes. In this effort, we build upon previous research by detailing the specification, design, and deployment of a series of GBL experiential learning interventions intended to improve conceptual understanding of vehicle dynamics. This implementation should result in positive downstream impacts on safety, both for the vehicle (i.e., design/interface)—and its driver. In our intervention, we deploy three separate pilot studies in a graduate engineering vehicle dynamics course, all of which leverage advanced GBL environments deployed on a high-fidelity motion-based driving simulator. The primary goals of the pilot studies are to interactively achieve an enhanced understanding of: (i) oversteer/understeer vehicles at ever-increasing speed; (ii) an optimal cornering strategy subject to the tire conditions of the vehicle; and (iii) lateral handling and yaw stabilization of a vehicle within an extreme evasive maneuver at varying entry speeds. The outcomes of the current effort serve to promote a future Theory of Change for planned best practices to improve human factors and human–vehicle machine interfaces through authentication of GBL in engineering education on a broader scale. © 2021 by the authors.

In this sense, it is relevant to define the state of the art of the contributions of data mining in the university environment, and from there, to see in perspective how these could be applied in scenarios of return to the face-to-face. In this sense, a systematic review of the literature is carried out, based on scientific evidence extracted from the Taylor & Francis, ERIC and Scopus databases. A qualitative content analysis approach and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement were used to extract the findings published in scientific articles. The results were that educational data mining was applied to a greater extent in the field of “teaching”, and it was focused on the search for patterns and predictive models to improve student performance, reduce student dropout, improve the student’s quality of life, and teacher performance. In addition, as a resource for data extraction, university learning management systems (LMS) were used to a greater extent. It is concluded that tools such as data mining should be implemented as academic management policies, achieving a prospective on indicators linked to the improvement of student learning and performance. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

Over recent years, there has been an increasing trend of students dropping out of university for various academic, social, economic, institutional, or personal reasons. This has significant impacts on private higher education institutions, whose main livelihood depends on student numbers, with some institutions in a critical situation. In this paper, we design and implement a data analytics model that predicts the risk of dropout that students may present. The sources of information used to construct this model contain academic and socioeconomic variables, covering past academic periods to understand the problem in detail. Machine Learning approaches are used to determine the best model using the CRISP-DM methodology. This model is deployed via a decision-making tool for the academic counseling office, whose main objective is to maximize student retention. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The primary purpose of the project was to address some of the challenges and opportunities afforded by increasing student and teacher diversity at a predominantly English-medium Australian university through newly enhanced human language translation technology (HLT) also known as machine translation (MT). This technology is frequently used for the translation of human language, and it falls under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. From the institution's perspective, key aims of the project were to contribute to the university's Digital Learning Strategy priorities and core values embedded in a structural transformation of the university. These include integrity, accountability, diversity, social justice, engagement and collaboration. The researchers' objectives focussed on multilingual pedagogies using HLT to support knowledge exchange (transknowledging), and translanguaging for all students. These disrupt inequitable hierarchies, and position bi-/multilingual students as valuable resources for monolingual staff and students. © AILA.",academic integrity; higher education; human language technology (HLT); inclusion; multilingualism; transknowledging; translanguaging,,"Arkoudis S., Yu X., Baik C., Borland H., Chang S., Lang I., Lang J., Pearce A., Watty K., Finding common ground: Enhancing interaction between domestic and international student: Guide for academics, ALTC, (2010); Global economic outlook.

But technologies in education go beyond the simple use of video lectures: technologies might be exploited to improve personal learning. In this paper, we focus on the dropout of studies, a global phenomenon that artificial intelligence techniques are trying to ameliorate. Here, we investigate whether data related to the consumption of video lectures might improve the students' dropout prediction. We consider first-year students enrolled in our Department and we characterize them with personal, scholastic, academic and technological features. Then, we measure the performance of three machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. The experimental evaluation shows that Random Forest and KNN perform better that Decision Tree and also shows that data related to the use of video lectures improves the prediction performance for some degree programs (reaching 73% in terms of accuracy and sensitivity). These preliminary results show that the approach is promising and worth exploring in future studies. © 2021 ACM.",Dropout prediction; Educational data mining; Machine learning,Data mining; Decision trees; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Students; Data usage; Dropout prediction; Educational data mining; Lecture data; Personal learning; Simple++; Technology in educations; University students; Use of video; Video lectures; Forecasting,"Aina C., Parental background and university dropout in Italy, Higher Education, (2013); Ameri S., Fard M.J., Chinnam R.B., Reddy C.K., Survival analysis based framework for early prediction of student dropouts, Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pp. 903-912, (2016); Biau G., Scornet E., A random forest guided tour, Test, pp. 197-227, (2016); Breiman L., Random forest, Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32, (2001); Casanova J., Mauricio R., Factors that determine the persistence and dropout of university students, Psicothema, (2018); Del Bonifro F., Gabbrielli M., Lisanti G., Zingaro S.P., Student dropout prediction, Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 129-140, (2020); Federico M., Furini M., An automatic caption alignment mechanism for off-The-shelf speech recognition technologies, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 72, 1, pp. 21-40, (2014); Furini M., On gamifying the transcription of digital video lectures, Entertainment Computing, 14, pp. 23-31, (2016); Furini M., On introducing timed tag-clouds in video lectures indexing, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 77, 1, pp. 967-984, (2018); Furini M., Galli G., Martini M.C., An online education system to produce and distribute video lectures, Mobile Networks and Applications, (2020); Furini M., Mirri S., Montangero M., Topic-based playlist to improve video lecture accessibility, 2018 15th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications Networking Conference (CCNC), pp. 1-5, (2018); Gaggi O., Palazzi C.E., Ciman M., Galiazzo G., Franceschini S., Ruffino M., Gori S., Facoetti A., Serious games for early identification of developmental dyslexia, Comput.

It is also significantly important that educational institutes be focused on tracking and improving the academic performance of each student. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors (i.e., diverse backgrounds, behaviors, etc.) that help students perform well. However, the increasing number of students makes it challenging and leaves a negative impact on credibility and resources due to the high dropout rates. Researchers tend to work on a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques for predicting student performance without giving much importance to their spatial and behavioral factors. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method that considers weighted key factors which have an impact on their performance. To achieve this, we first surveyed by considering experts’ opinions in selecting weighted key factors using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). Secondly, a geospatial-based machine learning technique was developed which integrated the relationship between students’ location-based features, semester-wise behavioral features, and academic features. Three different experiments were conducted to prove the superiority and predict student performance. The experimental results reveal that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) achieved higher accuracy of 90.9% as compared to other machine learning methods, for instance, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree (DT). Scientific analysis techniques (i.e., Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM)) and machine learning feature engineering techniques (i.e., Variance Threshold (VT)) were used in two different experiments for selecting features where scientific analysis techniques had achieved better accuracy. The finding of this research is that, along with the past performance and social status key factors, the semester behavior factors have a lot of impact on students’ performance.

It is a metric used by legislators, accreditation agencies, and governing bodies. Providing students with remedial assistance at the right time has often proven an effective method for student retention. Identifying students that require this type of support is usually cumbersome though. A variety of stakeholders, such as educators, counselors, advisors, and other staff members, may have to be involved in identifying students who are ""at-risk"". Following recent developments in machine learning algorithms, automated systems may be developed to predict students' performance and refer students to remedial instruction. This paper proposes the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict a student's grades in a university course at any given semester based on the initial performance of the student in a combination of course assessment tools, such as quizzes, assignments, and tests. The prediction model is based on a dataset of real cases compiled from courses at a private university in Saudi Arabia. The model, however, is general enough to be applied to any course at universities around the world. The prediction classifiers used in this study are Random Forest (RF), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Linear Regression (LR), Additive Regression (AR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Various metrics are employed to measure the prediction models' performance and assess the accuracy and validity of the proposed AI-based algorithms. Results indicate that the best classifier for predicting the final exam grade is the SMO, with a minimum mean absolute error of 2.350. The best prediction classifier for the midterm exam is LR with a minimum mean absolute error of 1.978. As tools for the early identification of students' difficulties in the particular courses in which they are enrolled, the effectiveness of the proposed models is discussed. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

Machine learning models have been shown to predict student dropouts accurately. Because students may drop out of school in any semester, the student history data recorded in the academic management system would have a different length. The different length of student history data poses a challenge for generating feature tables. Most current studies predict student dropouts in the first academic year and therefore avoid discussing this issue. The central assumption of these studies is that more than 50% of dropouts will leave school in the first academic year. However, in our study, we found the distribution of dropouts is evenly distributed in all academic years based on the dataset from a Korean university. This result suggests that Korean students’ data characteristics included in our dataset may differ from those of other developed countries. More specifically, the result that dropouts are evenly distributed throughout the academic years indicates the importance of a dropout prediction for the students in any academic year. Based on this, we explore the universal feature tables applicable to dropout prediction for university students in any academic year. We design several feature tables and compare the performance of six machine learning models on these feature tables. We find that the mean value-based feature table exhibits better generalization, and the model based on the gradient boosting technique performs better than other models. This result reveals the importance of students’ historical information in predicting dropout. © 2023 by the authors.",dropout prediction; educational data mining; machine learning; university student dropout,,"How Many Students Are at Risk of not Returning to School?; Investing in Higher Education: Benefits, Challenges, and the State of Student Debt, (2016); Del Savio A.A., Galantini K., Pachas A., Exploring the relationship between mental health-related problems and undergraduate student dropout: A case study within a civil engineering program, Heliyon, 8, (2022); Contreras D., Gonzalez L., Lascar S., Lopez V., Negative teacher–student and student–student relationships are associated with school dropout: Evidence from a large-scale longitudinal study in Chile, Int.

The significance of this study is to understand the state-of-art of techniques for recognizing the activities of humans based on physiological signals acquired by a body-worn sensors. Accurate recognition of activities with just signals from the wearable sensor is a difficult task due to the inherent complexity of physical activities. Even though sensor-based HAR has been accomplished by using various algorithms exploiting machine and deep learning techniques, just a handful of researchers have made an extensive study on the contribution of various parameters on the accuracy of recognition of human activity. The main focus of this study is to perform a comparative evaluation of the state-of-the-art algorithms based on machine and deep learning techniques that have been proposed for HAR. Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) methods are employed for data dimensional reduction and visualization. Machine learning algorithms like random forest (RF), kernel-based support vector machine (SVM), and deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied on the University of California, Irvine (UCI) HAR dataset. A comprehensive study has been conducted to understand the impact of changing parameters like pooling, activation functions, number of dense layers, and dropout percentage of CNN on the accuracy of recognition. The proposed work employed the swish activation function in the dense layer which was recently proposed by Google. The output layer of the last dense network employs the softmax function to classify human activities. The proposed CNN architecture (with max-pooling layer, the swish activation function in one dense layer, and softmax function at the output layer) achieved results of training and validation accuracy as 99.58% and 92.57% respectively for HAR. © 2022 Shilpa Ankalaki and Thippeswamy M.

While most research on the fairness of machine learning models in education focuses on discrimination by gender or race, other variables such as parental educational background or home literacy environment are known to impact children's literacy skills too. This paper, therefore, evaluates three different implementations of in-session dropout prediction models used in a learning platform to accompany German school classes with respect to their fairness based on four different fairness measures. We evaluate the models for discrimination of gender, migration background, parental education, and home literacy environment. While predictive parity and equal opportunity are rarely above the defined threshold, predictive equality and slicing analysis indicate that model quality is slightly better for boys, users with higher parental education, users with less than ten books, and users with a migrant background. Furthermore, our analysis of the temporal prediction shows that with increasing accuracy of the model, the fairness decreases. In conclusion, we see that the fairness of a model depends on 1) the fairness measure, 2) the evaluated demographic group and 3) the data with which the model is trained.

This study reviewed the top 50 AI in higher education studies in the Web of Science database from the perspective of highly cited papers and based on a technology-based learning model. The results show that predictions of learners’ learning status (including dropout and retention, student models, and academic achievement) are most frequently discussed in the AI in higher education studies; AI technology is most commonly applied in engineering (including computer courses); AI technologies most often play the role of profiling and prediction in higher education, followed by intelligent tutoring systems and assessment and evaluation. In terms of research issues, the most frequently discussed issues are learning behaviour, accuracy, sensitivity and precision, cognition and affect. Learners’ higher order thinking skills, collaboration or communication, self-efficacy or confidence and skills are less frequently discussed in AI in higher education studies. Accordingly, we propose potential research issues and practitioner notes for AI in higher education as a reference for researchers, educators and decision-makers. Implications for practice or policy: • Higher education practitioners and researchers need to be aware of the latest developments in the research and practice of AI in higher education. • Teachers need to understand the role they can play in teaching and learning practices through AI technology and how to use it to assist learners. • It is important for administrators of educational institutions to understand the challenges teachers face in their teaching practices with AI technology and to develop measures to support them © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

We use a large dataset consisting of undergraduates admitted to multiple study programs at eight faculties/schools of our university. Using data available at enrollment time, we develop Machine Learning (ML) methods to predict university dropout and underperformance, which show an AUC of 0.70 and 0.74 for each risk respectively. Among important drivers of dropout over which the first-year students have some control, we find that first year workload (i.e., the number of credits taken) is a key one, and we mainly focus on it. We determine the effect of taking a relatively lighter workload in the first year on dropout risk using causal inference methods: Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Inverse Propensity score Weighting (IPW), Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted (AIPW), and Doubly Robust Orthogonal Random Forest (DROrthoForest). Our results show that a reduction in workload reduces dropout risk. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Average treatment effect; Causal inference; Machine learning; University dropout,Decision trees; Large dataset; Students; Average treatment effects; Causal inferences; First year; Inference methods; Large datasets; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Undergraduate study; Underperformance; University dropout; Machine learning,"Albreiki B., Zaki N., Alashwal H., A systematic literature review of student’ performance prediction using machine learning techniques, Educ.

Managers and scholars in the field frequently rely entirely and expertise to recognise potential risk factors and students. This study looks at the research on the approaches and metrics being used now in learning analytics. While there are techniques available, our research shows that they are not focused on identifying difficult pupils as soon as possible. With the use of contemporary computer vision tools and methodologies, we design a novel statistical tool for class participation and develop a predictive model. It shows how pupils may be identified with 97% accuracy as early about week three. Additionally, we place this finding in a suitable pedagogical framework to support its application as a component of a more complete student assistance system. There is a wealth of publicly available learning data that can be utilised to analyse individual student behaviour, address their issues, improve the instructional climate, and enable data-driven choices, thanks to the support of software learning platforms. Based on that, the paper focuses on developing a system that can effectively monitor and predict the performance of students in degree programs by using the evolving machine learning.

Several studies were carried out in this theme, but there are still challenges to be addressed. There are many different applications of multilevel modeling for school dropouts, which makes it difficult to synthesize the main contributions and advances in the area. The lack of a holistic view makes it difficult to understand the main advances and research gaps. To shed some light on this scenario, this literature review covered the most investigated factors at the student and school levels, such as demographic, socioeconomic, family background, and student's academic performance variables; the main educational environments in which multilevel models were used for the analysis or prediction of school dropout, such as high school/secondary education, and higher education; and the main multilevel models used in these researches, such as the multilevel logistic regression, and the multilevel linear regression. In addition, we also investigated whether the authors used multivariate exploratory techniques or other artificial intelligence techniques to support the fitting and interpretation of the modeling process. © 2023 IEEE.",dropout impact factors; multilevel regression models; school dropout; systematic literature review,Education computing; Factor analysis; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Dropout impact factor; Holistic view; Impact factor; Literature reviews; Multilevel modeling; Multilevel regression modeling; Research gaps; School dropout; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Students,"Behr A., Giese M., Kamdjou H.D.T., Theune K., Motives for dropping out from higher education-an analysis of bachelor's degree students in Germany, European Journal of Education, 56, 2, pp. 325-343, (2021); Sequeda M.F., Et al., The effect of grade retention on secondary school dropout: Evidence from a natural experiment, (2020); McNeal R.B.J., Labor market effects on dropping out of high school: Variation by gender, race, and employment status, Youth & Society, 43, 1, pp. 305-332, (2011); Pov S., Kawai N., Murakami R., Identifying causes of lower secondary school dropout in Cambodia: A two-level hierarchical linear model, International Journal of Inclusive Education, pp. 1-14, (2020); Rotem N., Yair G., Shustak E., Open the gates wider: Affirmative action and dropping out, Higher Education, 81, 3, pp. 551-566, (2021); Contreras D., Gonzalez L., Lascar S., Lopez V., Negative teacher-student and student-student relationships are associated with school dropout: Evidence from a large-scale longitudinal study in Chile, International Journal of Educational Development, 91, (2022); Favero L.P., Belfiore P., Manual de análise de dados: Estatstica e modelagem multivariada com Excel, (2017); Lopez V., Cardenas K., Gonzalez L., The effect of school psychologists and social workers on school achievement and failure: A national multilevel study in Chile, Frontiers in psychology, 12, (2021); Barbosa-Camargo M.I., Garca-Sanchez A., Ridao-Carlini M.L., Inequality and dropout in higher education in Colombia. a multilevel analysis of regional differences, institutions, and field of study, Mathematics, 9, 24, (2021); Rotem N., Yair G., Shustak E., Dropping out of master's degrees: Objective predictors and subjective reasons, Higher Education Research & Development, 40, 5, pp. 1070-1084, (2020); Fontana L., Masci C., Ieva F., Paganoni A.M., Performing learning analytics via generalised mixed-effects trees, Data, 6, 7, (2021); Pellagatti M., Masci C., Ieva F., Paganoni A.M., Generalized mixed-effects random forest: A flexible approach to predict university student dropout, Statistical Analysis and Data Mining: The ASA Data Science Journal, 14, 3, pp. 241-257, (2021); Tete M., Sousa M., Santana T., Fellipe S., Predictive models for higher education dropout: A systematic literature review, Education Policy Analysis Archives, 30, (2022); Dalipi F., Imran A.S., Kastrati Z., Mooc dropout prediction using machine learning techniques: Review and research challenges, 2018 IEEE global engineering education conference (EDUCON).

In order to evaluate the success of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in predicting student dropout, a systematic review was conducted. The search was carried out in several electronic bibliographic databases, including Scopus, IEEE, and Web of Science, covering up to June 2023, having 246 articles as search reports. Exclusion criteria, such as review articles, editorials, letters, and comments, were established. The final review included 23 studies in which performance metrics such as accuracy/precision, sensitivity/recall, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated. In addition, aspects related to study modality, training, testing strategy, cross-validation, and confounding matrix were considered. The review results revealed that the most used Machine Learning algorithm was Random Forest, present in 21.73% of the studies; this algorithm obtained an accuracy of 99% in the prediction of student dropout, higher than all the algorithms used in the total number of studies reviewed. © 2023 Girn et al., licensed to EAI.

However, to achieve this goal, universities need to accurately identify and focus their efforts on students most likely to quit their studies before they graduate. This has given rise to a need to implement forecasting models to predict which students will eventually drop out. In this paper, we present an early warning system to automatically identify first-semester students at high risk of dropping out. The system is based on a machine learning model trained from historical data on first-semester students. The results show that the system can predict “at-risk” students with a sensitivity of 61.97%, which allows early intervention for those students, thereby reducing the student attrition rate. © 2023, Revista Electronica de Investigacion Educativa.

In recent years, machine learning has received a lot of attention in the fight against dropout. This is because machine learning technologies can successfully identify at-risk students and prepare precautionary measures in a timely manner. We consider predicting student's possible dropout rate from university programs prior to admission. To that purpose, we collect our own statistics from students who began their studies between 2014 and 2016. We are left with 2066 participants after preprocessing and cleaning. Six distinct binary classifiers, namely the Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Tree, and k - Nearest Neighbor models, were used to predict graduations and dropouts. According to research, the average performance of six models is 84%, 80%, 77%, 82%, 80%, and 81%. This type of research is critical in determining students' success rates at university programs based on their pre-university data.  © 2022 IEEE.",Artificial Neural Network; Decision Tree; Dropout; EDM; kNN; Naïve bayes; Random forest tree; SVM,Barium compounds; Binary trees; Classifiers; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Random forests; Risk assessment; Sodium compounds; Students; Support vector machines; Automated machines; Dropout; EDM; KNN; Naive bayes; Profile data; Random forest tree; Random forests; SVM; University programs; Decision trees,"Vandamme J.P., Meskens N., Superby J.F., Predicting academic performance by data mining methods, Education Economics, 405, 4, (2007); Taunk K., De S., Verma S., Swetapadma A., A Brief Review of Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for Learning and Classification, International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems, 201; Skalka J., Drlik M., Automated assessment and microlearning units as predictors of at-risk students and students' outcomes in the introductory programming courses, Applied Sciences, 4566, 13, (2020); Siemens G., Baker R.S.D., Learning analytics and educational data mining: Towards communication and collaboration, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, (2012); Shynarbek N., Orynbassar A., Sapazhanov Y., Kadyrov S., Prediction of Student's Dropout from a University Program, 16th International Conference on Electronics Computer and Computation (ICECCO), (2021); Shahiri A.M., Husain W., A review on predicting student's performance using data mining techniques, Procedia Computer Science, pp. 414-422, (2015); Shaun R., Baker J.D., Inventado P.S., Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics, pp. 61-75, (2014); Sales A., Balby L., Cajueiro A., Exploiting academic records for predicting student drop out: A case study in Brazilian higher education, Journal of Information and Data Management, 7, 2, (2016); Romero C., Ventura S., Educational data mining and learning analytics: An updated survey, WIREs Data Min.

Having been learning English for ten years roughly, students are not stimulated to engage in EAP taught with traditional lecture-based model. Team-based learning (TBL), a students-centered teaching and learning method originally and mainly used in the medical profession, has been trailed to improve students' active learning in EAP courses. This research compared lecture-based and TBL sessions which are used simultaneously in one semester. A mixed methodology, including the questionnaire Team-based Learning Student Assessment Instrument and focus group interviews, is adopted to evaluate the efficiency of TBL. The questionnaire evaluates students' accountability, preference and satisfaction with TBL. Results show that a majority of students have a positive experience with TBL and report higher accountability (89%), preference (94%) and satisfaction (99%). While most students have more preparation before class, higher engagement in classroom activities, and better knowledge retention with TBL, a few students claim that readiness assurance tests are time-consuming and they learn less in group discussion compared to instructor's lecture. What's worse, free riders make little contribution to teamwork. As an active learning strategy, TBL is demanding and challenging for students and is worth further exploration.  © 2022 ACM.",English for Academic Purposes (EAP); Lecture-based teaching; Team-based learning; Team-based Learning Student Assessment Instrument,Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Learning systems; Surveys; Teaching; Assessment instruments; Chinese students; English for academic purpose; First year; International co-operative programmes; Lecture-based teaching; Student assessment; Team-based learning; Team-based learning student assessment instrument; Students,"Michaelsen L.K., Sweet M., Team-based learning, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 2011, 128, pp. 41-51, (2011); Parmelee D.X., Michaelsen L.K., Twelve tips for doing effective team-based learning (tbl), Medical Teacher, 32, 2, pp. 118-122, (2010); Michaelsen L.K., Sweet M., The essential elements of team-based learning, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 2008, 116, pp. 7-27, (2008); Mennenga H.A., Development and psychometric testing of the team-based learning student assessment instrument, Nurse Educator, 37, 4, pp. 168-172, (2012); Nation L.M., Tweddell S., Rutter P., The applicability of a validated team-based learning student assessment instrument to assess United Kingdom pharmacy students' attitude toward team-based learning, Journal of Educational Evaluation for Health Professions, 13, (2016); Appleton J.J., Christenson S.L., Kim D., Reschly A.L., Measuring cognitive and psychological engagement: Validation of the student engagement instrument, Journal of School Psychology, 44, 5, pp. 427-445, (2006); Handelsman M.M., Briggs W.L., Sullivan N., Towler A., A measure of college student course engagement, The Journal of Educational Research, 98, 3, pp. 184-192, (2005); Jensen J.L., Holt E.A., Sowards J.B., Heath Ogden T., West R.E., Investigating strategies for pre-class content learning in a flipped classroom, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 27, 6, pp. 523-535, (2018); Reimschisel T., Herring A.L., Huang J., Minor T.J., A systematic review of the published literature on team-based learning in health professions education, Medical Teacher, 39, 12, pp. 1227-1237, (2017); Skinner E.A., Pitzer J.R., Developmental Dynamics of Student Engagement, Coping, and Everyday Resilience, pp. 21-44, (2012)","G.

The main objective of this study is to assess the probability of using Artificial Intelligence techniques such as deep and machine learning procedures to predict university student retention. In this study a variable assessment is carried out on the dataset which was collected from Kaggle repository. The performance of twenty supervised algorithms of machine learning and one algorithm of deep learning is assessed. All algorithms were trained using 10 variables from 1100 records of former university student registrations that have been registered in the University. The top performing algorithm after hyper-parameters tuning was NuSVC Classifier. Therefore, we were able to use the current dataset to create supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predicting student retention with F1-score (90.32 percent) for ML and the proposed DL algorithm with F1-score (93.05 percent). © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

The methodology makes use of an information package of 364 students with an admission period between 2007 and 2019, considering characteristics that can affect directly or indirectly in the graduation of each one, being: Type of high school, number of semesters taken, grade-point average, lockouts, dropouts and course terminations. The data treatment considered the manual removal of several characteristics that did not add value to the output of the algorithm, resulting in a package composed of 2184 instances. Thus, the logistic regression, MLP and XGBoost models developed and compared could predict a binary output of graduation or non-graduation to each student using 30% of the dataset to test and 70% to train, so that was possible to identify a relationship between the six attributes explored and achieve, with the best model, 94.15% of accuracy on its predictions. © 2022 Eurasian Society of Educational Research.

The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students' risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students' risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student's risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.  © 2020 ACM.,Background features; Bayesian analysis; Biographical characteristics; Identifying at-risk biographical profiles; Individual attributes; Model-based machine learning; Pre-college or schooling; South Africa,Decision trees; Education computing; Engineers; Probability distributions; Risks; Academic performance; Conceptual frameworks; Higher education institutions; Higher education researches; Interactive programs; Machine learning classification; Posterior probability; Random forest classification; Students,"Abed T., Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., A prediction model to improve student placement at a South African higher education institution, 2020 International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference.

It may depend on several factors, such as for example the knowledge area. In previous works we studied dropout and transfer paths using machine learning, obtaining several key factors that are predictive for analyzing drop out and transfer paths patterns. In this work we delve into this topic, making a more exhaustive study using again machine learning. Results show that Polynomial SVM is the method that obtains the highest performance for predicting university dropout. On the other hand, it is possible to identify the key factors affecting university dropout, showing in addition different factors depending on the field of study. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Dropout; Educational Data Analysis; Higher Education; Machine learning,Turing machines; Drop-out; Economic consequences; Knowledge areas; Transfer paths; Machine learning,"Arce M.E., Crespo B., Miguez-Alvarez C., Higher education drop-out in Spain-particular case of universities in galicia, IES, 8, 5, pp. 247-264, (2015); Braxton J.M., Milem J.F., Sullivan A.S., The influence of active learning on the college student departure process: toward a revision of tinto’s theory, J.

Many universities started to develop their own ontologies to get an understanding of their students by analyzing their data. In this paper, an information extraction framework is proposed as a part of the research project ""LET'SeGA"" to support educational institutions in selecting students for different programs. This would also help target specific student segments in marketing decisions for academic programs. In the proposed framework, an ontological model is created for universities' data which is used to support students' recruitment and retention ensuring students' success after admission. Future work will focus on testing the framework over a time period to verify that it supports the recruitment of appropriate student profiles. © 2019 The Authors.

Although the predictive capability of these models is important, interpretability is a crucial factor to look for as well, because the decisions to be made from their results have to be properly justified. In this paper, a novel methodology to develop analytical models balancing predictive performance and interpretability is proposed, with the aim of enabling a better decision-making. It proceeds by fitting logistic regression models through a modified stepwise variable selection procedure, which automatically selects input variables while keeping their business logic, previously validated by an expert. In synergy with this procedure, a new method for transforming independent variables in order to better deal with ordinal targets and avoiding some logistic regression issues with outliers and missing data is also proposed. The combination of these two proposals with some competitive machine-learning methods earned the leading position in the NPS forecasting task of an international university talent challenge posed by a well-known global bank. The application of the proposed methodology and the results it obtained at this challenge are described as a case-study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Churn prediction; Net Promoter Score; Stepwise regression; WOE variables,Analytical models; Balancing; Decision making; Forecasting; Learning systems; Metadata; Churn predictions; Logistic regression models; Machine learning methods; Net Promoter Score; Predictive capabilities; Predictive performance; Stepwise regression; WOE variables; Logistic regression,"Reichheld F., Markey R., The Ultimate Question 2.0 : How Net Promoter Companies Thrive in a Customer-Driven World, (2011); Reichheld F., The one number you need to grow, Harvard Bus.

There are a multitude of intrapersonal reasons to explain why students choose to leave the field of computer science, such as lack of confidence, a misconception or disinterest in computing, minimal collaboration, and lack of a proper support system (Gordon, 2016). In addition, some universities focus on theoretical computer science to the detrimental exclusion of practical aspects. SparkDev, a 9-week development program, aims to resolve these issues that students face. In this program, students are given the tools, resources and community to build projects with emerging technologies within areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, cyber security and mobile development. © 2019 IEEE.",Collaborative learning; Development; Retention,Artificial intelligence; Cyber security; Development programs; Emerging technologies; First year; Lack of confidences; Support systems; Theoretical computer science; Students,"Gordon Neil A., Issues with retention and attainment in computer science, ResearchGate, (2016); Retention in computer science undergraduate programs in the u.

This research method is a descriptive qualitative method. Data were obtained using observations, document analysis, and interviews, which involved 200 junior high school science teachers in six districts of Lampung province, data analyzed with percentage. The results of STEM literacy analysis on the planning of natural science learning on the topic of simple machine have a high category of planning average (61%) and the average category of implementation is also of a high category (65%). Data analysis shows that learning science in simple machine material had integrated STEM but focused more on science and rarely used technology in student learning. Also, teachers realize that applying the STEM approach makes student learning more relevant, stimulates the emergence of meaningful experiences, encourages students to think higher and solve problems and increase retention. So that by the demands of the revolutionary education era 4.0. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Learning systems; Machinery; Students; Document analysis; Junior high schools; Learning science; Qualitative method; research methods; Science learning; Science teachers; Student learning; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)","Pamungkas K., Subali B., Lunuwih S., Jurnal Inovasi Pendidikan Ipa, 3, 2, (2017); Chiappetta E.L., Koballa T.R., Science Instruction in the Middle and Secondary Schools Developing Fundamental Knowledge and skills7th Edition, (2010); Wulandari P.A., Prasetyo A.P.B., Rahayu E.S., Journal Unnes Lembaran Ilmu Pendidikan, 41, (2016); Ashari A., Hartati R., Jurnal Ilmiah Pendidikan Fisika Al-Biruni, 4, 2, (2015); Oecd, Results in Focus, (2016); Kemendikbud, Materi Pelatihan Guru Implementasi Kurikulum 2013 SMP/MTs Matematika, (2013); Firman H., In Seminar Nasional Pendidikan Ipa Dan Pklh, (2015); Wilujeng I., Setiawan A., Liliasari, Jurnal Cakrawala Pendidikan, 29, (2010); Ratumanan T.G., Laurens T., Mataheru W., Jurnal Matematika, 9, (2009); Rahayu W.K., Sudarmin, Unnes Science Educaion Journal, 4, (2015); Blackley S., Sheffield R., Koul R., Issues in Educational Research, 28, (2018); Rogers E.M., Diffusion of Innovations (5th Ed.), (2003); Tseng K.H., Chang C.C., Lou S.J., International Journal of Technology and Design Education, 23, 1, (2013); Sanders M., STEM, Stem Education, STEMmania. the Technology Teacher, (2009); Ismail I., Permanasari A., Ad Setiawan W., Jurnal Inovasi Pendidikan Ipa, 2, 2, (2016); Stohlmann M., Moore T.J., Roehrig G.H., Journal of Pre-College Education Research (J-PEER), 2, (2012); Abdurrahman, Achmad A., Nurulsari N., Journal of Physics: Conf.

Students are generally admitted based on their evaluated academic potentials as measured using their admission criteria scores. This study seeks to identify the relationship, if any, between the admission criteria scores and the graduation grades, and to examine the influence of ethnicity using the geopolitical zone of origin of the student on the predictive accuracy of the models developed using a Nigerian University as a case study. Data mining analyses were carried out using four classifiers on the Orange Software, and the results were verified with multiple regression analysis. The maximum classification accuracy observed is 53.2% which indicates that the pre-admission scores alone are insufficient for predicting the graduation result of students but it may serve as a useful guide. By applying over-sampling technique, the accuracy increased to 79.8%. The results establish that the ethnic background of the student is statistically insignificant in predicting their graduation results. Hence, the use of ethnicity in admission processes is therefore not ideal. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data mining algorithms; Educational data mining; Knowledge discovery; Machine learning; Nigerian university; Performance evaluation methodologies,Forecasting; Students; Classification accuracy; Educational tools; Learning process; Multiple regression analysis; Nigerians; Over sampling; Predictive accuracy; Data mining,"Ukiwo U., Education, horizontal inequalities and ethnic relations in Nigeria, Int J Educ Dev, 27, 3, pp. 266-281, (2007); Olujuwon T., Education in Nigeria: A futuristic perspective, Conference Proceedings of 4Th World Conference of the International Consortium for Educational Development 3–6 July, pp. 1-8, (2002); Okebukola P., Trends in tertiary education in Nigeria, pp. 84-102, (2000); (2015); Aluede O., Idogho P.O., Imonikhe J.S., Increasing access to university education in Nigeria: Present challenges and suggestions for the future, The African Symposium, (2012); Yusuf U., Map of the six geopolitical zone in Nigeria showing total number of registered voters, Geospatial Solutions Expert, (2018); National Population Estimates, National Population Commission and National Bureau of Statistics Estimates., (2017); Eze T., Sunday C., Ogbodo J.C., Patterns of inequality in human development across Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones, Dev Ctry Stud, 4, 8, pp. 97-101, (2014); Geopolitical Zones of Nigeria. 18 11 2018., (2018); Nigeria., (2018); Abernethy D.B., Nigeria creates a new region, Africa Rep, 9, 3, (1964); Agboola B., Ofoegbu F., Access to University Education in Nigeria: A Review, (2010); Antoniades N., Haan P., Government capabilities as drivers of performance: path to prosperity, Heliyon, 5, 2, (2019); Badejo J.A., Et al., Data sets linking ethnic perceptions to undergraduate students learning outcomes in a Nigerian Tertiary Institution, Data Brief, 18, pp. 760-764, (2018); Jin X., Et al., Significance and challenges of big data research, Big Data Res, 2, 2, pp. 59-64, (2015); Alharbi F.R., Khan M.B., Identifying comparative opinions in Arabic text in social media using machine learning techniques, SN Appl Sci, 1, 3, (2019); Romero C., Ventura S., Educational data mining: a review of the state of the art, IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part C (Appl Rev), 40, 6, pp. 601-618, (2010); Lakshmipadmaja D., Vishnuvardhan B., Classification performance improvement using random subset feature selection algorithm for data mining, Big Data Res, 12, pp. 1-12, (2018); Bradac V., Walek B., A comprehensive adaptive system for e-learning of foreign languages, Expert Syst Appl, 90, pp. 414-426, (2017); Hegazi M.O., Abugroon M.A., The state of the art on educational data mining in higher education, Int J Comput Trends Technol, 31, 1, pp. 46-56, (2016); Sahin A., Top N., Delen E., Teachers’ first-year experience with chromebook laptops and their attitudes towards technology integration, Technol Knowl Learn, 21, 3, pp. 361-378, (2016); Haraty R.A., Bitar G., Associating learning technology to sustain the environment through green mobile applications, Heliyon, 5, 1, (2019); El Alfy S., Gomez J.M., Ivanov D., Exploring instructors’ technology readiness, attitudes and behavioral intentions towards e-learning technologies in Egypt and United Arab Emirates, Educ Inf Technol, 22, 5, pp. 2605-2627, (2017); Fernandes E., Et al., Educational data mining: predictive analysis of academic performance of public school students in the capital of Brazil, J Bus Res, 94, pp. 335-343, (2019); Adekitan A.I., Salau O., The impact of engineering students’ performance in the first three years on their graduation result using educational data mining, Heliyon, 5, 2, (2019); Rumbold J.M.M., Pierscionek B.K., What are data?

In this study, thirty-eight fully task-naive participants were trained in a fixed-base setting in the Human-Machine Interaction Laboratory at Delft University of Technology and subsequently divided into three matched groups based on their training performance and control behavior. Performance of the first group was re-evaluated after a period of non-practice of six months, whereas the second group was retested at both three and six months after training, and skill retention of the third group was measured after two, four, and six months. The goal of the experiment was to model the decay curve of skill-based manual control behavior and to determine the re-acquisition rate of lost skills compared to their initial acquisition rate. To explicitly quantify changes in manual control skills, learning curve models were fitted to metrics of task performance and control activity. The results suggest that control skills decay following a negatively accelerating decay curve and that lost skills are re-acquired at a higher rate than their initial development rate. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

That is essential in order to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing the excellent learning resources and experience, and improving the university’s ranking and reputation. However, that might be difficult to be achieved for startup to mid-sized universities, especially those which are specialized in graduate and post graduate programs, and have small students’ records for analysis. So, the main aim of this project is to prove the possibility of training and modeling a small dataset size and the feasibility of creating a prediction model with credible accuracy rate. This research explores as well the possibility of identifying the key indicators in the small dataset, which will be utilized in creating the prediction model, using visualization and clustering algorithms. Best indicators were fed into multiple machine learning algorithms to evaluate them for the most accurate model. Among the selected algorithms, the results proved the ability of clustering algorithm in identifying key indicators in small datasets. The main outcomes of this study have proved the efficiency of support vector machine and learning discriminant analysis algorithms in training small dataset size and in producing an acceptable classification’s accuracy and reliability test rates. © 2019, The Author(s).",Classification algorithms; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Small dataset; Visualization,,"Asif R., Merceron A., Ali S.A., Haider N.G., Analyzing undergraduate students’ performance using educational data mining, Computers in Education, 113, pp. 177-194, (2017); Brodersen K.H., Ong C.S., Stephan K.E., Buhmann J.M., The balanced accuracy and its posterior distribution, Proceedings - international conference on pattern recognition, (2010); (1990); Comendador B.E.V., Rabago L.W., Tanguilig B.T., An educational model based on knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) to predict learner’s behavior using classification techniques, 2016 IEEE Int.

To alleviate this problem, it is important to detect as soon as possible student attrition before he or she becomes a deserter. A student may be considered a deserter when she/he has not completed her academic credits or leave the studies. In this paper we present a study made at a higher education institution, by analyzing the records of 530 higher education students from 52 different careers with application date 2015 to 2018, considering factors such as academic monitoring, financial situation, personal and social information. These are some issues or mix of problems that could affect dropout rates. Analyze student behavior by implementing predictive analytics techniques reduce the gaps between professional demands and applicants' competencies. We applied predictive analytical techniques to identify the relationship of factors characterizing students who leave the university. As a result, we have elaborated a conceptual model to predict the risk of defection and applied machine learning techniques to generate preventive and corrective alerts as a student permanence strategy. This study shows that information is important, but the application of machine learning in the student's prior knowledge and its relationship to a dynamic and pre-established profile of the deserter student is essential to generate early strategies that manage to reduce the gaps between professional demands and applicants' competencies. In addition, a data model has been created to give solution to the issue get generated preventive and corrective alerts.  © 2020 IEEE.",Dropout model; Student retention in higher education; University dropout prediction,Education computing; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Applied machine learning; Conceptual model; Data analysis techniques; Higher education institutions; Higher education students; Prior knowledge; Social information; Student behavior; Students,"Fonseca G., Garcia F., Permanencia y Abandono de Estudios en Estudiantes Universitarios: Un Análisis Desde la Teoría Organizacional - Science Direct, 45, 179, pp. 25-39, (2016); Diaz Peralta C., Modelo conceptual para la deserción estudiantil universitaria Chilena, Estudios Pedagógicos (Valdivia), 34, 2, pp. 65-85, (2008); Kotsiantis S.B., Pierrakeas C.J., Pintelas P.E., Preventing student dropout in distance learning using machine learning techniques, Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems, pp. 267-274, (2003); Hernandez-Jimenez M.T., Et al., A descriptive study of sociodemographic and motivational variables associated with dropping out of school: A perspective of freshman university students, Revista Educación, 44, 1, pp. 210-229, (2020); Chung J.Y., Lee S., Dropout early warning systems for high school students using machine learning, Children and Youth Services Review, 96, pp. 346-353, (2019); Abu-Oda G.S., El-Halees A.M., Data Mining in Higher Education: University Student Dropout Case Study, (2015); Respondek L., Seufert T., Stupnisky R., Nett U.E., Perceived academic control and academic emotions predict undergraduate university student success: Examining effects on dropout intention and achievement, Front.

These challenges include lack of institutional research to discover new knowledge, unfavorable methods of instruction, especially the language conflict, access to education for marginalized and isolated communities, high dropout rates, depleted infrastructure and unavailability of resources, overpopulated classrooms, and a biased grading system. This paper discusses alternative machine learning solutions to these challenges faced by the African higher education system, in order to ensure that students develop the skills needed to thrive in this digital era. Findings reveal three key technological solutions that can provide alternative solutions to these challenges, and they include customized/personalized learning, predictive analytics and digital administrative management, and virtual assistance. This paper concludes that for Africa, Catching up with the world goes beyond adopting these new innovations to facilitate learning. Recommendations include rethinking the content of the African curriculum, developing an unbiased education system, and adopting a suitable medium of instruction. © 2020 Conscientia Beam.",,,"State of education in Africa report 2015, (2015); Alemu S.

Prior to the pandemic, one of the biggest problems for university institutions was the dropout and dropout of many of their students. Today, the situation has become even more critical, as the pandemic has forced many people to drop out of school for a variety of reasons, whether financial or personal. Investigating the causes of dropout with appropriate means to reduce it contributes to decision making within academic management. The objective of this work is to develop a machine learning model that generates early warnings about course loss, which is based on historical data of pupils and students. The model is based on historical data from an undergraduate program that includes, student grades, at various points in time, percentage of course loss in previous semesters, percentage of student loss in previous semesters, subjects passed at the time of evaluating the data, along with student and course average. This would facilitate the identification and internal management of alarms for the early detection of potential dropouts, as well as efficiently display the results found with the execution of these models. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Dropout prevention; Higher education; Machine learning; Random forest,Behavioral research; Decision trees; Education computing; Machine learning; Academic managements; Academic performance; Decisions makings; Drop-out; Dropout prevention; High educations; Historical data; Machine learning models; Performance Modeling; Random forests; Students,"Tasa De Crecimiento económico Del Sector De Las Tic aumentó 4,04 % En Los Dos Primeros Trimestres De 2019-Tasa De Crecimiento económico Del Sector De Las Tic aumentó 4,04 % En Los Dos Primeros Trimestres De 2019.

In this study two different datasets are used: (1) data obtained from the TalTech study information system; (2) students’ history and study results collected in Virumaa College. To build predictive models, the following machine learning algorithms are applied: Naïve Bayes, decision trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. As a result of this study were evaluated how the dropout prediction accuracies change from the moment of the students’ admission to the end of the first semester. We found, that data that were available about students before enrollment allowed to predict dropout with 70% of accuracy. Using data that obtained from first semester allowed to rise prediction accuracy to 90%. Besides, the factors were determined that are related with drop-out and that are not. Any higher education institution can conduct a similar study, since it is conducted on publicly available data from the official academic information environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Prediction; Students’ dropout,Decision trees; Drops; Education computing; Engineering education; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Predictive analytics; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Computer science students; Drop-out; First year; Higher education institutions; Information environment; Machine learning methods; Prediction accuracy; Predictive models; Students,"Must O., Must A., Kõrgkoolist väljalangevus ja üliõpilaste enesemäärtlus, (Students dropout and self-definition), Tartu Ülikool, (2017); Whitlock J.L., Using data science and predictive analytics to understand 4-year university student churn.

To achieve this goal, we applied two new advanced deep learning models. One is EntityDenseNet to estimate real-time ground-level PM2.5 from Himawari-8 satellite data, and the other is called batch normalization and robust neural network (BRNN) to retrieve temperature and humidity profiles using data from a ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR). Many features and technologies have been introduced in these two models, in particular: (1) a dropout layer for each hidden layer in the deep learning model has been introduced to reduce the overfitting problem; (2) the problems of saturation and vanishing gradients are overcome by using the ReLU as the activation function; and (3) the data between the inputs in model are normalized by batch normalization technology, which fixes the mean and variance of the inputs to accelerate the training process. A detailed comparison with various traditional machine learning models (backpropagation neural network, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and random forest) has been conducted in this research, using the same training and test data sets. From the comparison, the new models reduce overfitting and has a greater capacity to describe nonlinear relationships. In addition, the EntityDenseNet can “peek inside the black box” to extract the spatio-temporal features of data. The EntityDenseNet is able to map variables that are close to each other to an embedding space. It enables us to calculate the distance between different variables in this space. The smaller the distance, the higher the correlation between two features could be found. This ability greatly improves interpretability of the deep learning model inversion result. This work reveals that these two advanced deep learning models significantly improves retrieval accuracy, and demonstrates strong potential in the application of EntityDenseNet and BRNN for additional earth-observation datasets and scenarios. We have created an EntityDenseNet Cloud Platform (http://49.233.1.40:8888/), it is free to access and researchers can use it for their own data modelling. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

Especially, the classification methods based on three-dimensional convolutional neural network have remarkable performance due to the uniqueness of hyperspectral images. However, the hyperspectral classification still faces great challenges due to a series of problems such as the insufficient extraction of spectral-spatial features, the lack of labeled samples, the large amount of noise, the tendency of overfitting and so on. Therefore, SSDANet is proposed to solve the above problems and promote the further development of hyperspectral classification technology based on deep learning. SSDANet is a spectral-spatial three-dimensional convolutional neural network with a deep and wide structure that can significantly improve classification performance. In SSDANet, the spectral-spatial dense connectivity is put forward to protect the integrity of information. It is made up of the spectral branch and the spatial branch, which can learn and reuse the spectral-spatial features. Besides, the spectral-spatial attention mechanism is proposed to adapt the special structure of hyperspectral images. It can excite important spectral-spatial information and suppress unimportant spectral-spatial information. In addition, a series of optimization methods including data augmentation, batch normalization, dropout, exponential decay learning rate, and L2 regularization are adopted to alleviate the problem of overfitting and improve the classification results. To verify the performance of SSDANet, experiments were implemented on two widely used datasets - Pavia University and Indian Pines. Under the condition of limited labeled samples, the classification evaluation indexes of OA, AA, and Kappa on the two datasets all exceeded 99%, reaching state-of-the-art performance. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; hyperspectral imaging; image processing; pattern recognition; remote sensing,Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Spectroscopy; Classification evaluation; Classification methods; Classification performance; Classification results; Hyper-spectral classification; Optimization method; Spatial informations; State-of-the-art performance; Image classification,"Landgrebe D., Hyperspectral image data analysis, IEEE Signal Process.

In a recent undergraduate-cohort-studies report, the DHET highlight the low percentage of students completing their degrees in the allotted time, having remained between 25.7% and 32.2% for the academic years 2000 to 2017, that is, every year since 2000, more than 67% of the learners enrolled did not complete their degrees in minimum time. In this paper, we set up two prediction tasks aimed at the early-identification of learners that may need academic assistance in order to complete their studies in the allocated time. In the first task we employed six classification models to deduce a learner's end-of-year outcome from the first year of registration until qualifying in a three-year degree. The classification task was a success, with Random Forests attaining top predictive accuracy at 95.45% classifying the “final outcome” variable. In the second task we attempt to predict the time it is most likely to take a student to complete their degree based on enrolment observations. We complete this task by employing six classifiers again to deduce the distribution over four risk profiles set up to represent the length of time taken to graduate. This phase of the study provided three main contributions to the current body of work: (1) an interactive program that can calculate the posterior probability over a student's risk profile, (2) a comparison of the classifiers accuracy in deducing a learner's risk profile, and (3) a ranking of the employed features according to their contribution in correctly classifying the risk profile variable. Random Forests attained the top accuracy in this phase of experiments as well, with an accuracy of 83%. © 2021 ASTES Publishers.

Laboratory drying or wetting tests are the most efficient way to identify the SWRC while they remain time-consuming, costly and somewhat uncertain. In the recent developments, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have arisen as a promising means in various scientific domains including some applications in geotechnical engineering. The UNSODA unsaturated soil hydraulic database (Leij et al. 1996) is here used to provide measured water retention data on a wide range of soils. This data is used to train some of the most common machine learning prediction algorithms (Regression Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Process Regression, Artificial Neural Network). The training of the models was satisfactory with the drying tests data while higher errors were obtained with wetting tests dataset. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method was found to give the most accurate predictions. The consistency of the ANN predicted curve for the drying path is finally checked trough a parametric study. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Prediction; Soil water retention curve,Drying; Engineering education; Forecasting; Geotechnical engineering; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Soil moisture; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Wetting; Accurate prediction; Gaussian process regression; Geo-environmental problems; Geotechnical parameters; Machine learning techniques; Parametric study; Prediction algorithms; Soil water retention curves; geotechnical engineering; hydraulic property; machine learning; prediction; soil water; water retention; Machine learning,"Fredlund D.G., Rahardjo H., Fredlund M.D., Unsaturated Soil Mechanics in Engineering Practice, (2012); Arya L.M., Paris J.F., A physicoempirical model to predict the soil moisture characteristic from particle-size distribution and bulk density data, Soil Sci.

Analysis of data generated from student interaction with learning management systems (LMSs) in blended learning (BL) environments may assist with the identification of students at risk of failing, but to what extent this may be possible is unknown. However, existing studies are limited to address the issues at a significant scale. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a new approach harnessing applications of machine learning (ML) models on a dataset, that is publicly available, relevant to student attrition to identify potential students at risk. The dataset consists of the data generated by the interaction of students with LMS for their BL environment. Findings: Identifying students at risk through an innovative approach will promote timely intervention in the learning process, such as for improving student academic progress. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the accuracy is compared with other representational ML methods. Originality/value: The best ML algorithm random forest with 85% is selected to support educators in implementing various pedagogical practices to improve students’ learning. © 2021, Kiran Fahd, Shah Jahan Miah and Khandakar Ahmed.",Boosting ensemble technique;

With ANN-based EDM, humongous amount of student data in higher institutions could be harnessed for informed academic advisory that promotes adaptive learning for purposes of student retention, student progression, and cost saving. Mining students’ data optimally requires predictive data mining tool and machine learning technique like ANN. However, despite acknowledging the capability of ANN-based EDM for efficiently classifying students’ learning behavior and accurately predicting students’ performance, the concept has received less than commensurate attention in the literature. This seems to suggest that there are gaps and challenges confronting ANN-based EDM in higher education. In this study, we used the systematic literature review technique to gauge the pulse of researchers from the viewpoint of modeling, learning procedure, and cost function optimization using research studies. We aim to unearth the gaps and challenges with a view to offering research direction to upcoming researchers that want to make invaluable contributions to this relatively new field. We analyzed 190 studies conducted in 2010–2018. Our findings reveal that hardware challenges, training challenges, theoretical challenges, and quality concerns are the bane of ANN-based EDM in higher education and offer windows of opportunities for further research. We are optimistic that advances in research along this direction will make ANN-based EDM in higher education more visible and relevant in the quest for higher education-driven sustainable development. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",,Cost functions; Learning systems; Neural networks; Students; Adaptive learning; Cost saving; Data-mining tools; High educations; Industry needs; Network-based; Predictive data mining; Raise the bars; Student retention; Systematic literature review; Data mining,"Abdel-Hamid O., Convolutional neural networks for speech recognition, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, Automoc, Czechoslovakia, 22, pp. 1533-1545, (2014); Abidi S.M.R., Hussain M., Xu Y., Zhang W., Prediction of confusion attempting algebra homework in an intelligent tutoring system through machine learning techniques for educational sustainable development, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, (2018); Acevedo Y.V.N., Marin C.E.M., System architecture based on learning analytics to educational decision makers toolkit, Advances in Computer Science and Engineering, 13, 2, pp. 89-105, (2014); Ali L., Asadi M., Gasevic D., Jovanovic J., Hatala M., Factors influencing beliefs for adoption of a learning analytics tool: An empirical study, Computers & Education, 62, 2013, pp. 130-148, (2013); Ali L., Hatala M., Gasevic D., Jovanovic J., A qualitative evaluation of evolution of a learning analytics tool, Computers & Education, 58, 1, pp. 470-489, (2012); Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2010); Avella J.T., Kebritchi M., Nunn S.G., Kanai T., Smith L., Meinzen-Derr J., Learning analytics methods, benefits, and challenges in higher education: a systematic literature review, Online Learning, 20, 4, pp. 201-211, (2016); Bahadir E., Using neural network and logistic regression analysis to predict prospective mathematics teachers’ academic success upon entering graduate education, Educational Sciences: Theory & Practice, 16, pp. 943-964, (2016); Barneveld A.V., Arnold K.E., Campbell J.P., Analytics in higher education: establishing a common language, Educause Learning Initiative ELI Paper, 1, (2012); Bassel G.W., Glaab E., Marquez J., Holdsworth M.J., Bacardit J., Functional network construction in arabidopsis using rule-based machine learning on large-scale data sets, The Plant Cell, 23, 9, pp. 3101-3116, (2011); Bengio Y., Practical recommendations for gradient-based training of deep architectures, Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade.

Improving the success and quality of enrolled students is one of the most important concerns. It is important to observe the initial symptoms of students at risk and implement earlier preventive measures to determine the cause of the student dropout rate. In this research, we will use data mining techniques to identify the factors that affect student success. We will use the data consisting of log data and grades from students from a course at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Croatia. We will use the data that consists of log data and grades of students from a course at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Croatia. In this study, machine learning methods are used to evaluate the performance of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods in the task of binary classification of whether a student fails or passes the exam. The results show that the deep neural network has a very good performance, the second-best, and with the optimizations, there are many opportunities for even better generalization.  © 2021 Croatian Society MIPRO.",classification; deep learning; machine learning; moodle; student performance prediction,Data mining; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Logistic regression; Random forests; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Croatia; Deep learning; Log data; Log grades; Machine learning methods; Moodle; Performance prediction; Student performance; Student performance prediction; Student success; Students,"Guo H., Wang L., Chen F., Liang D., Scientific big data and digital earth, Chinese Science Bulletin (Chinese Version), 59, (2014); Injadat M., Moubayed A., Nassif A.B., Shami A., Systematic ensemble model selection approach for educational data mining, Knowledge-Based Syst, 200, (2020); About Moodle-Moodle Documentation; Sukhbaatar O., Ogata K., Usagawa T., Mining educational data to predict academic dropouts: A case study in blended learning course, TENCON 2018-2018 IEEE Region 10 Conference, pp. 2205-2208, (2018); Hassan H., Anuar S., Ahmad N.B., Students' performance prediction model using meta-classifier approach, Engineering Applications of Neural Networksx, 1000, pp. 221-231, (2019); Helal S., Et al., Predicting academic performance by considering student heterogeneity, Knowledge-Based Syst, 161, pp. 134-146, (2018); Myles A.J., Feudale R.N., Liu Y., Woody N.A., Brown S.D., An introduction to decision tree modeling, J.

Previous research has looked into attitudes among those who leave CS, as well as the impact of taking specific courses; we build on this body of research using large-scale analysis of course evaluations and students' academic history. Our goal is to understand their potential connection to a student's performance and retention within the CS major. We process course-specific data, faculty evaluations, and student demographic data through various machine learning-based classifiers to understand the predictive power of each feature. We find our algorithm performs significantly better for higher-performing students than lower-performing ones, but do not find that evaluations significantly improve predictions of students doing well in courses and staying in the major. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

Research shows that the dropout rate for disabled students is much higher at 31.5% when compared with about 12.3% for non-disabled students in the EU. Supporting young students with special educational needs while pursuing higher education is an ambitious and important role, which needs to be adopted by tertiary education providers worldwide. We propose, MALSEND, a conceptual platform based on human-machine intelligence (HMI), a collective intelligence of human and machine to understand patterns of learning of disabled students in higher education. This platform aims to accommodate and analyse data sets features of universities activities to discover trends in performances with regards to subject areas for autistic students, dyslexic students and students having attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), among others. Analysis of variables, such as students’ performances in modules, courses and other engagement-indices will give new insights into research questions, career advice and institutional policymaking. This paper describes the developmental activities of the MALSEND concept in phases. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",Machine learning; MALSEND; Performance; Special educational needs; Unsupervised learning,Learning systems; Machine learning; Unsupervised learning; Collective intelligences; Conceptual approaches; MALSEND; Performance; Special educational needs; Tertiary education; Universities and colleges; University students; Students,"Kryszewska H., Teaching students with special needs in inclusive classrooms special educational needs, ELT J, 71, 4, pp. 525-528, (2017); Advice and Financial Support.

At present, students’ dropout rate in university is gradually increasing and many bright students sometimes just cannot cope with the universities. The first-year result of a student is very important because in the majority of cases this drives the students to be either motivated or demotivated. So, the first-year student performance of a renowned university in Bangladesh is investigated in this paper. This research is mainly based on finding the reasons for students’ different types of results and then predicting students’ performance based on those eleven significant factors. For this purpose, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm, random forests (RF) have been used for classifying students’ different levels of results and predicting students’ performances. The input dataset for both training and testing were taken by merging the values obtained from two surveys done on students and experts using fuzzy ANFIS analysis. The result exhibits that RF can perform the classification of multiple classes based on many distinguishing features with 96.88 percent accuracy. This proposed model can also be applied to predict course-wise students’ performances and its precision can also be greatly improved by adding new factors. © IEOM Society International.",Classification; Fuzzy ANFIS; Performance Prediction; Random Forest Classifier,,"Devasia T., Vinushree T.

Degrees such as Computer Science in particular are in ever greater demand. Although the number of students has increased, the number graduating is still not enough to provide society with as many as it requires. This study contributes to reversing this situation by introducing an approach that not only predicts the dropout risk or students’ performance but takes action to help both students and educational institutions. The focus is on maximizing graduation rates by constructing a Recommender System to assist students with their selection of subjects. In particular, the challenge is addressed of constructing reliable Recommender Systems on the basis of data which are both sparse and few in quantity, imbalanced, and anonymized, and which might have been stored under imperfect conditions. This approach is successfully applied to create a Recommender System using a real-world dataset from a public Spanish university containing performance data of a Computer Science degree course, demonstrating its successful application in real environments. The construction of a support system based on that approach is described, its results are evaluated, and its implications for students’ academic achievement, and for institutions’ graduation rates are discussed. Through the construction of this decision support system for students, we intend to increase the graduation rates and lower the dropout rate. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

One of the most significant discussions in higher education is student attrition in their first year of study. Student career guidance is an area that requires investigation in light of high attrition rates at university. Recent developments in data analytics, and the analysis of large data sets have enabled the production of powerful predictive models. This paper highlights how a predictive model can assist students, with an interest in Science to develop a skill profile required to be successful in their undergraduate Science programme. This is achieved by identifying the difference between the necessary skills required to be successful in a science programme (derived using data driven approaches) from the current learner's skill profile (derived from the learners' performance in assessments). The learners' skill profile is used to predict success in four Science streamlines. Based on the prediction results, we gauge the improvement in skills required to succeed in that programme. We provide the following contributions: (a) a trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over learners' success in Science streamlines focused around the notion of skill profiles; (b) a ranking of these skill profiles according to their information gain (entropy); and (c) an interactive program to calculate the posterior probability over these skill profiles given learner's pre-university observations. We argue that it is crucial that students gauge the focus areas of skill improvement prior to enrolling for their degree so that they can consider streams in Science degrees that are suited to their academic strengths. © 2020 IEEE.",Machine Learning Classification; Schooling Observations; Student Attrition; Suitability of Science streamline,Classification (of information); Data Analytics; Education computing; Gages; Predictive analytics; Probability distributions; Data-driven approach; Higher education institutions; Information gain; Interactive programs; Posterior probability; Predictive modeling; Predictive models; Student supports; Students,"Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Nkambule T., Against all odds: The role of'community cultural wealth'in overcoming challenges as a black African woman: Part 2: Being and belonging in South African higher education: The voices of black women academics, South African Journal of Higher Education, 28, 6, pp. 1999-2012, (2014); Usher E.L., Ford C.J., Li C.R., Weidner B.L., Sources of math and science self-efficacy in rural appalachia: A convergent mixed methods study, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 57, pp. 32-53, (2019); Abed T., Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., A prediction model to improve student placement at a South African higher education institution, 2020 International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference, pp. 1-6, (2020); Nicholas J., Poladian L., Mack J., Wilson R., Mathematics preparation for university: Entry, pathways and impact on performance in first year science and mathematics subjects, International Journal of Innovation in Science and Mathematics Education (Formerly CALlaborate International), 23, 1, (2015); Giannakos M.N., Pappas I.O., Jaccheri L., Sampson D.G., Understanding student retention in computer science education: The role of environment, gains, barriers and usefulness, Education and Information Technologies, 22, 5, pp. 2365-2382, (2017); Dukhan S., Cameron A., Brenner E.A., The influence of differences in social and cultural capital on students' expectations of achievement, on their performance, and on their learning practices in the first year at university, International Journal of Learning, 18, 7, (2012); Msimanga A., Denley P., Gumede N., The pedagogical role of language in science teaching and learning in South Africa: A review of research 1990-2015, African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 21, 3, pp. 245-255, (2017); Stoffelsma L., Spooren W., The relationship between english reading proficiency and academic achievement of first-year science and mathematics students in a multilingual context, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, pp. 1-18, (2018); Prinsloo E., Implementation of life orientation programmes in the new curriculum in South African schools: Perceptions of principals and life orientation teachers, South African Journal of Education, 27, 1, pp. 155-170, (2007); Beaulac C., Rosenthal J.S., Predicting university students' academic success and major using random forests, Research in Higher Education, pp. 1-17, (2019); Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., Dukhan S., Forecasting learner attrition for student success at a South African university, Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists 2020 (SAICSIT '20), September 14-16, 2020, Cape Town, South Africa.

While the education system has established the globally well-received lecture system, abysmal student attention retention reports are alarming. According to these new findings and reports, the modern education system cannot engage students, especially when higher education is concerned. We have serious games as a possible solution to increase engagement and help students and scholars have a more exciting learning experi-ence. However, designing serious games in a way that they can serve both their educational and entertainment purpose can be extremely difficult. After achieving this feat, they must appeal to a vast audience if we consider them an alternative to conventional education. In this review paper, we analyze the effects of multiple projects that use adaptive AI to achieve this feat, all of which are tailored towards students and scholars and, more importantly, developed by a collective of institutes or governments. Furthermore, this paper reviews some of the notable methods and possible solutions to achieve adaptability in serious games. By the end of this paper, we show the importance and effectiveness of an adaptive AI in serious games in order to solve the issues of our modern education system.  © 2021 IEEE.",adaptive environments; artificial intelligence; learning; serious games; video game engines,Artificial intelligence; Human computer interaction; Students; 'current; Adaptive environment; Education systems; Game Engine; High educations; Learning; Modern educations; Review papers; Video game engine; Video-games; Serious games,"Prensky M., Digital Game-based Learning, (2001); Bakkes S., Spronck P., Herik Den J.Van, Rapid and reliable adaptation of video game ai, IEEE Trans.

The goal of the study is to understand the important features, and to derive models for predicting student retention. Issues dealing with real world data, for example variable definition, missing data handling, and data cleaning were discussed. A new recursive feature elimination based feature selection method was developed. This study derived features and models for four different student groups, the first-generation students, the African American students, the Hispanic students, and the disabled students. The features identified and the predictive models built were compared crossed the four groups. © 2019 IEEE.",Classification; Data cleaning; Feature selection; Predictive analytics; Retention,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data Science; Education computing; Derived features; Disabled students; Feature selection methods; Important features; Predictive models; Recursive feature elimination; Student retention; Undergraduate students; Students,"Next Generation Learning Technical Report, (2010); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Herzog S., Measuring determinants of students returns vs dropout/stopout vs transfer: A first to second year analysis of new freshmen, Research in Higher Education, 46, (2005); Ronco S.L., Cahill J., Does it matter who's in the classroom?

A country's prosperity depends, among other factors, on its ability to produce higher education graduates capable of moving a country forward. To alleviate the dropout problem, more and more institutions are turning to the possibilities that artificial intelligence can provide to predict dropout as early as possible. The difficulty of accessing personal data and privacy issues that it entails force the institutions to rely on the Academic Data of their students to create accurate and reliable predictive systems. This work focuses on creating the best possible predictive model based solely on academic data, and accordingly, its capacity to infer knowledge must be maximised. Thus, Feature Engineering and Instance Engineering techniques such as dealing with redundancy, significance of the features, correlation, cardinality features, missing values, creation or elimination of features, data fusion, removal of unuseful instances, binning, resampling, normalisation, or encoding are applied in detail before the construction of well-known models such as Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine along with an Ensemble of them at different stages: Prior to enrolment, at the end of the first semester, at the end of the second semester, at the end of the third semester, and at the end of the fourth semester. Through the construction of these predictive models that serve as inputs to a decision support system, the application of effective dropout prevention policies can be applied.  © 2013 IEEE.",Ensemble models; Feature engineering; Instance engineering; Machine learning; Real experiences; Student dropout,Data fusion; Data privacy; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Education computing; Engineering education; Support vector machines; Different stages; Ensemble models; Feature engineerings; High educations; Instance engineering; Predictive models; Privacy issue; Professional development; Real experience; Student dropout; Students,"Perez F., Aldas J., Aragon R., Zaera I., Indicadores Sintéticos de Las Universidades Espanolas, (2019); MacFadyen L.P., Dawson S., Mining LMS data to develop an 'early warning system' for educators: A proof of concept, Comput.

In Brazil, similar to other countries, there is a representative amount of engineering students that enroll in engineering majors, however, they don't get to graduate in those majors. Information about the reason for that phenomenon is important for action on the matter by university decisionmakers. This paper aims to answer the research question: What are the main factors that motivate engineering students to drop out of engineering majors at UnB? We have collected the social and performance data of engineering students from 2009 to 2019. Some of the data can be considered rare in similar studies, like students' distance from home to campus and factors like students' leave of absence requests rather than performance factors. We used three data mining techniques: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Boosting algorithm (GBM) and Random Forest(RF). The results of the study showed that international students deserve some attention from the university and courses like Physics 1 can be challenging for engineering students. © 2019 IEEE.",EDM; Educational Data Mining; Machine Learning; Students dropout rate,Data mining; Decision trees; Drops; Engineering education; Learning systems; Machine learning; Random forests; Analysis of data; Boosting algorithm; Educational data mining; Generalized linear model; International students; Performance factors; Research questions; Undergraduate engineering students; Students,"Baker R.S., Inventado P.S., Educational data mining and learning analytics, Learning Analytics, pp. 61-75, (2014); Romero C., Ventura S., Educational data mining: A survey from 1995 to 2005, Expert Systems with Applications, 33, 1, pp. 135-146, (2007); Dutt A., Ismail M.A., Herawan T., A systematic review on educational data mining, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 15991-16005, (2017); Pena-Ayala A., Educational data mining: A survey and a data miningbased analysis of recent works, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 4, pp. 1432-1462, (2014); Zaffar M., Iskander S., Hashmani M.A., A study of feature selection algorithms for predicting students academic performance, Int.

Forty-five third-year veterinary students voluntarily participated in a simulation module on canine endotracheal intubation. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study investigated the impact of video (n = 23) versus handout (n = 22) instructions on student confidence, anxiety, and task performance. Students self-scored their confidence and anxiety before and after the simulation. During the simulation laboratory, three raters independently evaluated student performance using a 20-item formal assessment tool with a 5-point global rating scale. No significant between- or within-group differences (p > .05) were found for both confidence and anxiety scores. Video-based instructions were associated with significantly higher (p < .05) total formal assessment scores compared with handout-based instructions. The video group had significantly higher scores than the handout group on 3 of the 20 individual skills (items) assessed: Placement of tie to the adaptor-endotracheal tube complex (p < .05), using the anesthetic machine (p < .01), and pop-off valve management (p < .001). Inter-rater reliability as assessed by Cronbach's α (.92), and Kendall's W (.89) was excellent and almost perfect, respectively. A two-faceted crossed-design generalizability analysis yielded G coefficients for both the handout (Ep2 = .68) and the video (Ep2 = .72) groups. Video instructions may be associated with higher performance scores than handout instructions during endotracheal intubation simulation training. Further research into skill retention and learning styles is warranted. © 2020 AAVMC.",Competency-based assessment; Endotracheal intubation; Formal assessment tool; Simulation; State Anxiety Score,"Animals;

In Hungary, especially in STEM undergraduate programs, the dropout rate is particularly high, much higher than the EU average. In this work, using advanced machine learning models such as deep neural networks and gradient boosted trees, we aim to predict the final academic performance of students at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The dropout prediction is based on the data that are available at the time of enrollment. In addition to the predictions, we also interpret our machine learning models with the help of state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values. The accuracy and AUC of the best-performing deep learning model are 72.4% and 0.771, respectively that slightly outperforms XGBoost, the cutting-edge benchmark model for tabular data. © 2020 ACM.",dropout prediction; explainable artificial intelligence; higher education; interpretable machine learning; neural networks,Deep neural networks; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Students; Academic performance; Benchmark models; Budapest University; College students; Higher education; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Undergraduate program; Deep learning,"Abu-Oda G.S., El-Halees A.M., Data mining in higher education: University student dropout case study, International Journal of Data Mining & Knowledge Management Process, 5, 1, (2015); Agrusti F., Mezzini M., Bonavolonta G., Deep learning approach for predicting university dropout: A case study at roma tre university, Journal of E-Learning and Knowledge Society, 16, 1, pp. 44-54, (2020); Alkhasawneh R., Hobson R., Modeling student retention in science and engineering disciplines using neural networks, Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)., pp. 660-663, (2011); Arik S.O., Pfister T., TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning, (2019); Asif R., Merceron A., Abbas Ali S., Ghani Haider N., Analyzing undergraduate students' performance using educational data mining, Computers & Education, 113, 2017, pp. 177-194, (2017); Aulck L., Nambi D., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Mining university registrar records to predict first-year undergraduate attrition, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 9-18, (2019); Beaulac C., Rosenthal J.S., Predicting university students' academic success and major using random forests, Research in Higher Education, 60, 7, pp. 1048-1064, (2019); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Dekker G., Pechenizkiy M., Vleeshouwers J., Predicting students drop out: A case study, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 41-50, (2009); Dutt A., Akmar Ismail M., Herawan T., A systematic review on educational data mining, IEEE Access, 5, 2017, pp. 15991-16005, (2017); Fike D.S., Fike R., Predictors of first-year student retention in the community college, Community College Review, 36, 2, pp. 68-88, (2008); Education at A Glance: OECD Indicators 2013, (2013); Hernandez-Blanco A., Herrera-Flores B., Tomas D., Navarro-Colorado B., A systematic review of deep learning approaches to educational data mining, Complexity Special Issue, pp. 1-22, (2019); Heublein U., Student drop-out from German higher education institutions, European Journal of Education, 49, 4, pp. 497-513, (2014); Von Hippel P.T., Hofflinger A., The data revolution comes to higher education: Identifying students at risk of dropout in Chile, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, pp. 1-22, (2020); Kim B.-H., Vizitei E., Ganapathi V., GritNet: Student Performance Prediction with Deep Learning, (2018); Kiss B., Nagy M., Molontay R., Balint C., Predicting dropout using high school and first-semester academic achievement measures, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Emerging ELearning Technologies and Applications (ICETA).

One of the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) is to elevate the B40 household group towards the middle-income society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households belong to this group. The government of Malaysia has widened access to higher education for the B40 group in an effort to reduce the gaps in socioeconomics and to improve their living standards. Statistical data shows that since 2013, a yearly intake of students in bachelor’s degree programs in Malaysia’s public universities amounts to more than 85,000. Despite this huge number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate, including students from low-income family background. Data mining approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping out in general education. However, machine learning related works on student attrition in Malaysia’s higher education is generally lacking. Therefore, in this research, three machine learning models were developed using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network algorithm in order to classify attrition among B40 students in bachelor’s degree programs in Malaysia’s public universities. Comparative performance analysis between the three models indicates that the Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the other two models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with the value of 95.93%, 97.10%, 81.26% and 88.50%, respectively. Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant difference in performance between the Random Forest model and Decision Tree model but no statistically significant difference between Random Forest models and Artificial Neural Network model. © 2020.

Identification of the student with the highest risk of dropping out is generally used to apply corrective actions (WHO). Therefore, it is also important to determine WHEN a student will drop out, which is fundamental to planning preventive actions. In this work, we perform a study to quantitatively compare several approaches to address the early identification of dropout students in universities. We categorize our study into three main methods families, i.e., analytical methods, traditional classification methods, and probabilistic methods. The first is exploited at preprocessing step for selecting significant variables into the dropout identification task. The second uses machine learning models to classify students into dropout prone or non-dropout prone classes. The third family uses survival models to determine when the student would desert. To evaluate the predictive capacity of the classification models, the Kappa coefficient was incorporated into the usual machine learning metrics and shows that Kappa is handy for evaluating performance in unbalanced data. Similarly, in the survival models, the concordance index was applied to evaluate the predictive capacity. Our approach was applied over a real data set of Peruvian university graduate students to identify when and who will drop out. ©2021 IEEE.",Machine learning; Survival analysis; University dropout,Drops; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Comparatives studies; Corrective actions; Drop-out; Educational institutions; Predictive capacity; Preventive action; Survival analysis; Survival model; University dropout; University students; Students,"Kapur D., Crowley M., Beyond The Abcs: Higher Education and Developing Countries, (2008); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Druzdzel M.J., Glymour C., What do college ranking data tell us about student retention?, Intelligent Information Systems IV Proceedings of The Workshop Held in Augustów, pp. 1-10, (1995); Ramos Beltrame W.A., Goncalves O.L., Socioeconomic data mining and student dropout: Analyzing a higher education course in Brazil, International Journal for Innovation Education and Research, 8, 8, pp. 505-518, (2020); Balenzano C., Moro G., Cassibba R., Education and social inclusion: An evaluation of a dropout prevention intervention, Research on Social Work Practice, 29, 1, pp. 69-81, (2019); Ameri S., Fard M.J., Chinnam R.B., Reddy C.K., Survival analysis based framework for early prediction of student dropouts, Proceedings of The 25th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, CIKM’16, pp. 903-912, (2016); Barbosa A.M., Santos E., Gomes J.P.P., A machine learning approach to identify and prioritize college students at risk of dropping out, XXVIII Simpósio Brasileiro De Informática Na Educação SBIE (Brazilian Symposium on Computers in Education), pp. 1497-1506, (2017); Solis M., Moreira T., Gonzalez R., Fernandez T., Hernandez M., Perspectives to predict dropout in university students with machine learning, 2018 IEEE International Work Conference on Bioinspired Intelligence (IWOBI), pp. 1-6, (2018); Medina E.C., Chunga C.B., Armas-Aguirre J., Grandon E.E., Predictive model to reduce the dropout rate of university students in perú: Bayesian networks vs. Decision trees, 2020 15th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), pp. 1-7; Juajibioy J.C., Study of university dropout reason based on survival model, Open Journal of Statistics, 6, 5, pp. 908-916, (2016); Rumberger R.W., Thomas S.L., The distribution of dropout and turnover rates among urban and suburban high schools, Sociology of Education, 73, 1, pp. 39-67, (2000); Pedraza D., Beruvides M., The relationship between course assignments and academic performance: An analysis of predictive characteristics of student performance Texas tech university, ASEE’S 123rd Annual Conference & Exposition, (2016); Henson R., Expectancy beliefs, ability, and personality in predicting academic performance, The Journal of Educational Research, 70, 1, pp. 41-44, (1976); Greefrath G., Koepf W., Is there a link between preparatory course attendance and academic success?

In the field of Facial Expression Recognition (FER), although there are many recognition systems using DNNs, their accuracy and practicality are still not suitable for practical applications. This paper proposed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network method for FER in videos. This neural network consists of a Stem layer, a 3D Inception-ResNets structure, a GRU layer, a Dropout layer, an Island layer and a Softmax layer, which can capture spatial relationships in facial expression images and temporal relationships among different face frames. In order to increase the contribution degree of the important face component in the expression recognition, important feature point information of the facial expression was extracted and input into the network structure. In addition, a new Island loss function with strong ability to distinguish different features is introduced. It can not only reduce the intra-class variations, but also enlarge the inter-class differences, which could better ignore the effects of facial expression variability and sensitivity, and achieve higher recognition accuracy and generalization ability. The proposed method was evaluated for using three public available databases in subject-independent and cross-database tasks and outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.",CNN; DNN; FER; GRU; Island loss; Softmax,Education computing; Face recognition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic facial expression; Expression recognition; Facial expression recognition; Generalization ability; Softmax; State-of-the-art methods; Temporal relationships; Deep learning,"Mehrabian A., Communication without words [M], Psychology Today, 2, 4, pp. 53-56, (1968); Ekman P., Friesen W.V., Constants across cultures in the face and emotion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 17, 2, (1971); Pantic M., Valstar M., Rademaker R., Maat L., Web-based database for facial expression analysis, 2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo, (2005); Bo J., Lun X., Xin L., Jing H., Zhi-Liang W., Microexpression spotting using optical flow magnitude estimation, Journal of ZheJiang University (Engineering Science); Zhan Y.Z., Cheng K.Y., Chen Y.B., Et al., A new classifier for facial expression recognition: Fuzzy buried markov model [J], Journal of Computer Science and Technology, 25, 3, pp. 641-646, (2010); Chen J., Chen Z., Chi Z., Fu H., Facial expression recognition in video with multiple feature fusion, IEEE Transactionson Affective Computing, 9, 1, pp. 38-50, (2018); Yao Y., Huang D., Yang X., Wang Y., Texture and geometry scattering representation-based facial expression recognition in 2D+3D videos, ACM Trans, Multimedia Comput.

Research in this field is a matter of interest for each of the governments to improve education policies. Therefore, the analysis of data on the behavior of a student in an educational institution is of utmost importance, because multiple aspects of progress or student dropout rates during their professional training period can be identified. The most important variables to identify the student’s behavior are the socio-economic ones, since the psychological state and the economic deficiencies that the student faces while is studying can be detected. This data provides grades, scholarships, attendance and information on student progress. During the first phase of the study, all the information is analyzed and it is determined which provides relevant data to develop a profile of a student behavior, as well as the pre-processing of the data obtained. In this phase, voracious algorithms are applied for the selection of attributes, such as greedy stepwise, Chi-squared test, Anova, RefiefF, Gain Radio, among others. In this work, we apply the artificial intelligence techniques, the results obtained are compared to generate a normal and unusual behavior of each student according to their professional career. In addition, the most optimal model that has had a higher accuracy percentage, false positive rate, false negative rate and mean squared error in the tests results are determined. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Artificial intelligence; Behavior profiles; Decision trees; Education; Neural networks; Student,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Decision trees; Developing countries; Education; Education computing; Employment; Forestry; Mean square error; Neural networks; Professional aspects; Systems engineering; Accuracy percentages; Artificial intelligence techniques; Behavior profiles; Educational institutions; False positive rates; Professional careers; Professional training; Selection of attributes; Students,"Gasevic D., Dawson S., Siemens G., Let’s not forget: Learning analytics are about learning, Techtrends, 59, 1, pp. 64-71, (2015); Bakharia A., Et al., A conceptual framework linking learning design with learning analytics, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge – LAK 2016, pp. 329-338, (2016); Fidalgo-Blanco A., Sein-Echaluce M.L., Garcia-Penalvo F.J., Conde M.A., Using learning analytics to improve teamwork assessment, Comput.

Plenty of algorithms have been employed to measure student's GPA in the next semester's courses. The results can be used to early identify dropout students or help students choose the elective courses which are appropriate for them. The most widely used methods are machine learning, however, the problem is the accuracy which can be changed from dataset to dataset. More importantly, the performance of prediction models can be affected by the characteristic of dataset associated with the applied model. In this paper, we build a distributed platform on Spark to predict missing grades of elective courses for undergraduate students. The paper compares several methods that are based on the combination of Collaborative Filtering & Matrix Factorization (namely Alternative Least Square). We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using a dataset provided by Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT). The dataset consists of information about undergraduate students from 2006 to 2017.

Evasion data in higher education courses show the pessimistic scenario of fragility that configures education, mainly in underdeveloped countries. In this context, this paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for predicting dropout using machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Multilayer perceptron, and Deep Learning based on socioeconomic data. With the use of socioeconomic data, it is possible to identify in the act of pre-registration who are the students likely to evade, since this information is filled in the pre-registration form. This paper proposes the automation of the prediction process by a method capable of obtaining information that would be difficult and time consuming for humans to obtain, contributing to a more accurate prediction. With the advent of IoT, it is possible to create a highly efficient and flexible tool for improving management and service-related issues, which can provide a prediction of dropout of new students entering higher-level courses, allowing personalized follow-up to students to reverse a possible dropout. The approach was validated by analyzing the accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision parameters. The results showed that the developed system obtained 99.34% accuracy, 99.34% F1 score, 100% recall, and 98.69% precision using Decision Tree. Thus, the developed system presents itself as a viable option for use in universities to predict students likely to leave university. © 2020 by the authors.

Promoting educational quality and improving the quality of learners are challenging for our government. One of the most common educational problems is a university dropout problem which has a negative impact not only on the economic level but also on the personal level of students. Then, in this study, we focus on the study of factors affecting undergraduates' educational status and to create binary classification models for predicting their educational status whether will be Dropout or Other (i.e., other statuses which are not dropout) when they were studying at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Bangkok, Thailand. By applying the principles of data mining and machine learning techniques, we first collect data from the KMUTT internal data sources, i.e., Registrar's Office and KMUTT Library After that we investigate the completeness and the quality of the data, as well as we, investigate which features are meant to improve the accuracy and applicability of our models. Particularly, the data used in our analysis are from 13,714 undergraduate students in 7 academic years which are from the academic year 2012-2013 to 2019-2020. We develop 3 classifiers based on a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classification. The results show that the prediction accuracy of gradient boosting, decision tree and random forest models are 93%, 92%, and 92% respectively. Moreover, we found that the top 5 important features are student's academic year, high-school GPA, channels of university admission, student's faculty, and gender. In summary, the model constructed using gradient boosting outperforms the others with the most accuracy and recall but the random forest model can outperform the others with the most dropout status precision. © 2020 IEEE.",Classification; Decision Tree; Dropout; Education; Gradient Boosting; Prediction; Random Forest,Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data mining; Decision trees; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Random forests; Binary classification; Educational problems; Educational qualities; Machine learning techniques; National development; Random forest modeling; Undergraduate students; University admissions; Students,"Rawengwan P., Seresangtakul P., A model for forecasting educational status of students, The National and International Graduate Research Conference 2017, (2017); Sweeney M., Lester J., Rangwala H., Next-term student grade prediction, 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), (2015); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting Student Dropout in Higher Education, (2016); Abu A., Educational data mining students' performance prediction, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 7, 5, (2016); Kemper L., Vorhoff G., Wigger B.U., Predicting student dropout: A machine learning approach, European Journal of Higher Education, 10, 1, pp. 28-47, (2020); Pradeep A., Thomas J., Predicting college students dropout using edm techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 123, pp. 26-34, (2015); Chawla N.V., Bowyer K.W., Hall L.O., Kegelmeyer W.P., Smote: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Sun Y., Wong A.K.C., Kamel M.S., Classification of imbalanced data: A review, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 23, 4, pp. 687-719, (2009)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097332837,,

To address this problem we developed a tool that, by exploiting machine learning techniques, allows to predict the dropout of a first-year undergraduate student. The proposed tool allows to estimate the risk of quitting an academic course, and it can be used either during the application phase or during the first year, since it selectively accounts for personal data, academic records from secondary school and also first year course credits. Our experiments have been performed by considering real data of students from eleven schools of a major University. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Decision support tools; Educational data mining; Machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Learning systems; Risk perception; Academic course; Economic costs; First year; Learning process; Machine learning techniques; Secondary schools; Undergraduate students; Students,"Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting student dropout in higher education, 2016 ICML Workshops #Data4Good Machine Learning, pp. 16-20, (2016); Breiman L., Random forests, Mach.

Among minority students the graduation rate drops to 46% for Blacks and 55% for Hispanics. Low graduation rates not only impact the financial well-being of individuals but the economy as a whole. Thus, improving student retention, in particular, minority student retention, is of paramount importance at institutions of higher education. This paper describes a machine learning approach to predicting minority native and transfer student dropout using a dataset from a four year Hispanic serving institution in the north eastern region of the United States with a large percentage of minority students. The results of the study show that standard machine learning models can predict minority transfer student dropout with a high degree of accuracy of 97% and minority native student dropout with an accuracy of 81%. The features that were most important in predicting minority transfer student dropout were SAT scores, and college cumulative GPA, while high school GPA and college cumulative GPA were the top predictors for minority native student dropout. This study demonstrates that educational institutions can use cost effective off-the-shelf standard machine learning models to achieve a high degree of accuracy in predicting minority student dropout. The high prediction accuracy achieved helps in reliably identifying at-risk minority students and providing them with necessary interventions to support their academic success. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

This is particularly the case as Big Data initiatives have taken off in the federal, private and academic sectors, providing a wealth of opportunities, nationally and internationally. The Broadening Participation in Data Mining (BPDM) workshop was created more than 7 years ago with the goal of fostering mentorship, guidance, and connections for minority and underrepresented groups in the data science and machine learning community, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure for a group of talented students. To date it has impacted the lives of more than 330 underrepresented trainees in data science. We provide a venue to connect talented students with innovative researchers in industry, academia, professional societies, and government. Our mission is to facilitate meaningful, lasting relationships between BPDM participants to ultimately increase diversity in data mining. This most recent workshop took place at Howard University in Washington, DC in February 2019. Here we report on the mentoring strategies that we undertook at the 2019 BPDM and how those were received. © 2020 ACM.",broadening participation; data science; retention; underrepresented populations,Data Science; Academic sectors; Broadening participation; Howard University; Innovative strategies; Machine learning communities; Research and application; Under-represented groups; Washington; Data mining,"Cullinane J., Diversifying the stem pipeline: The model replication institutions program, Institute for Higher Education Policy.

Our database currently contains 3,495 points of data (i.e., headcounts), each containing 1,246 items of numerical value. Last year, we reported on an analysis that focused on the 'student dropout' phenomenon by using these data from both current graduate and dropout students. This year, we formulated a research question that is centered on predicting the probability of students' progress and academic abilities through Enrollment Management / Institutional Research (EMIR). We obtained results with these data by processing them through a machine learning technique using random forest, which yielded a correction rate of about 90%. © 2019 IEEE.",academic ability; EMIR; machine learning; Random Forest,Data handling; Decision trees; Learning systems; Machine learning; Random forests; Academic ability; EMIR; Enrollment management; General management; Machine learning techniques; Numerical values; Research questions; Students,"Construction of Education for University, (2008); Anegawa K., The impact of learning and living environments of colleges on dropout rates, Kyushu Daigaku Daigakuin Keizaigakukai, 149, pp. 1-16, (2014); Takamatsu K., Murakami K., Takao K., Asahi J., Kirimura T., Bannaka K., Noda I., Mitsunari K., Nakamura T., Nakata Y., Probability prediction of dropout of students on emir, Proceeding 7th Meet.

Modern machine learning algorithms can use large data sets to build useful tools for the data provider, in this case, the university. In this article, two classifiers are constructed using random forests. To begin, the first two semesters of courses completed by a student are used to predict if they will obtain an undergraduate degree. Secondly, for the students that completed a program, their major is predicted using once again the first few courses they have registered to. A classification tree is an intuitive and powerful classifier and building a random forest of trees improves this classifier. Random forests also allow for reliable variable importance measurements. These measures explain what variables are useful to the classifiers and can be used to better understand what is statistically related to the students’ situation. The results are two accurate classifiers and a variable importance analysis that provides useful information to university administrations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Academic success; Classification tree; Higher education; Machine learning; Random forest; Student retention; Variable importance,,"Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting Student Dropout in Higher Education, (2016); Bailey M.A., Rosenthal J.S., Yoon A.H., Grades and incentives: assessing competing grade point average measures and postgraduate outcomes, Studies in Higher Education, 41, 9, pp. 1548-1562, (2016); Bar T., Kadiyali V., Zussman A., Grade information and grade inflation: The cornell experiment, Journal of Economic Perspectivs, 23, 3, pp. 93-108, (2009); Breiman L., Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman L., Heuristics of instability and stabilization in model selection, The Annals of Statistics, 24, 6, pp. 2350-2383, (1996); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breiman L., Friedman J.H., Olshen R.A., Stone C.J., Classification and regression trees, (1984); Chen R., DesJardins S.L., Exploring the effects of financial aid on the gap in student dropout risks by income Level, Research in Higher Education, 49, 1, pp. 1-18, (2008); Chen R., DesJardins S.L., Investigating the impact of financial aid on student dropout risks: Racial and ethnic differences, The Journal of Higher Education, 81, 2, pp. 179-208, (2010); Chen Y.-L., Hsu C.-L., Chou S.-C., Constructing a multi-valued and multi-labeled decision tree, Expert Systems with Applications, 25, 2, pp. 199-209, (2003); Chou S., Hsu C.-L., MMDT: A multi-valued and multi-labeled decision tree classifier for data mining, Expert Systems With Applications, 28, 4, pp. 799-812, (2005); Clare A., King R.D., Knowledge discovery in multi-label phenotype data, Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: 5Th European Conference, PKDD 2001, pp. 42-53, (2001); Eddelbuettel D., Francois R., Rcpp: Seamless R and C++ integration, Journal of Statistical Software, 40, pp. 1-18, (2011); Glaesser J., Cooper B., Gender, parental education, and ability: their interacting roles in predicting GCSE success, Cambridge Journal of Education, 42, 4, pp. 463-480, (2012); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The elements of statistical learning, (2009); Hothorn T., Hornik K., Zeileis A., Unbiased recursive partitioning: A conditional inference framework, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 15, 3, pp. 651-674, (2006); Johnson S.R., Stage F.K., Academic engagement and student success: Do high-impact practices mean higher graduation rates, The Journal of Higher Education, pp. 1-29, (2018); Johnson V.E., Grade inflation: A crisis in college education, (2003); Kappe R., vander Flier H., Predicting academic success in higher education: what’s more important than being smart?, European Journal of Psychology of Education, 27, 4, pp. 605-619, (2012); Kim H., Loh W.-Y., Classification trees with unbiased multiway splits, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 96, pp. 589-604, (2001); Kononenko I., On biases in estimating multi-valued attributes, Proceedings of the 14Th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2, pp. 1034-1040, (1995); Leeds D.M., DesJardins S.L., The effect of merit aid on enrollment: A regression discontinuity analysis of iowa’s national scholars award, Research in Higher Education, 56, 5, pp. 471-495, (2015); Liaw A., Wiener M., Classification and regression by randomforest, R News, 2, 3, pp. 18-22, (2002); Loh W.-Y., Regression trees with unbiased variable selection and interaction detection, Statistica Sinica, 12, pp. 361-386, (2002); Loh W.-Y., Shih Y.-S., Split selection methods for classification trees, Statistica Sinica, 7, pp. 815-840, (1997); Mills J.S., Blankstein K.R., Perfectionism, intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation, and motivated strategies for learning: A multidimensional analysis of university students, Personality and Individual Differences, 29, 6, pp. 1191-1204, (2000); Niessen A.S.M., Meijer R.R., Tendeiro J.N., Predicting performance in higher education using proximal predictors, PLoS ONE, 11, 4, pp. 1-14, (2016); Ost B., The role of peers and grades in determining major persistence in sciences, Economics of Education Review, 29, pp. 923-934, (2010); Sabot R., Wakeman-Linn J., Grade inflation and course choice, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 5, pp. 159-170, (1991); Strobl C., Boulesteix A.-L., Zeileis A., Hothorn T., Bias in random forest variable importance measures: Illustrations, sources and a solution, BMC Bioinformatics, 8, 1, (2007); Degree Requirements (H.B.A., H.B.Sc., Bcom), (2017)","C.

ENEE101 is the introductory course to electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at the University of Maryland (UMD) [1] [2]. This course provides first-year students with a glimpse into the broad field of ECE through high-level hands-on labs, with the goal of increasing student retention rates and boosting performance in sophomoreyear courses; preliminary results have shown an upward trend in major retention and a downward trend in failures. Facultyproposed modules cover a wide range of sub-disciplines in ECE, including optical communications, internet of things, and computer vision. Computer vision has become a popular topic in academia and industry due to its applications in machine learning, artificial intelligence, image recognition, self-driving cars, and more. Through our computer vision module for ENEE101, we seek to answer the following question: How can freshman students, with possibly no prior knowledge of basic programming, actively learn and engage with computer vision? Our solution is to present students with three hands-on labs using the well-known Microsoft Kinect hardware along with open source computer vision software libraries. The labs we introduce cover depth sensing, hand tracking, facial recognition, and body detection. Each topic covers a single day of lab where the students are taught the basics of each concept and complete a C++ template with simple but elegant solutions, built and executed with Microsoft Visual Studio. The goal is to help students realize the impactful applications of computer vision by exposing them to complex computer vision topics through easily understandable, real-life scenarios. By achieving this goal, we better prepare students for careers as scientists and engineers. © 2019 FYEE Conference.",Body Tracking; Computer Vision; Depth Sensing; Facial Recognition; Gesture Recognition; Module Based Learning,Artificial intelligence; C++ (programming language); Computer hardware; Face recognition; Image recognition; Laboratories; Open source software; Open systems; Optical communication; Professional aspects; Students; Electrical and computer engineering; Facial recognition; First year students; Introductory course; Scientists and engineers; Software libraries; Student retention; University of Maryland; Computer vision,"Gomez R., Babadi B., Bhattacharyya S., Goldhar J., Khaligh A., Mogul N., Levine W.

Consequently, a large number of students have been admitted to universities regardless of whether they have an aptitude for academic studies. Early diagnosis of students with a high dropout risk enables interventions to be provided early on, which can help these students to complete their studies, graduate, and enhance their future competitiveness in the workplace. Effective prelearning interventions are necessary, therefore students’ learning backgrounds should be thoroughly examined. This study investigated how big data and artificial intelligence can be used to help universities to more precisely understand student backgrounds, according to which corresponding interventions can be provided. For this study, 3552 students from a university in Taiwan were sampled. A statistical learning method and a machine learning method based on deep neural networks were used to predict their probability of dropping out. The results revealed that student academic performance (regarding the dynamics of class ranking percentage), student loan applications, the number of absences from school, and the number of alerted subjects successfully predicted whether or not students would drop out of university with an accuracy rate of 68% when the statistical learning method was employed, and 77% for the deep learning method, in the case of giving first priority to the high sensitivity in predicting dropouts. However, when the specificity metric was preferred, then the two approaches both reached more than 80% accuracy rates. These results may enable the university to provide interventions to students for assisting course selection and enhancing their competencies based on their aptitudes, potentially reducing the dropout rate and facilitating adaptive learning, thereby achieving a win-win situation for both the university and the students. This research offers a feasible direction for using artificial intelligence applications on the basis of a university’s institutional research database. © 2020, The Author(s).",Academic performance; Deep learning; Dropout; Machine learning; Precision education; Statistical learning; Student background characteristics,,"Abadi M., Agarwal A., Barham P., Brevdo E., Chen Z., Citro C., Zheng X., Tensorflow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous distributed systems, (2016); Abu Zohair L.M., Prediction of student’s performance by modelling small dataset size, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 16, (2019); Ardila D., Kiraly A.P., Bharadwaj S., Choi B., Reicher J.J., Peng L., Et al., End-to-end lung cancer screening with three-dimensional deep learning on low-dose chest computed tomography, Nature Medicine, 25, 6, pp. 954-961, (2019); Bort J., Amazon’s warehouse-worker tracking system can automatically pick people to fire without a human supervisor’s involvement, 26), (2019); Chen C.-H., Su C.-Y., Using the BookRoll e-book system to promote self-regulated learning, self-efficacy and academic achievement for university students, Educational Technology & Society.

Before enrolling in a program, the Admission Office tries to help those students to decide whether that program is best suited for them. They do so by using collected empirical data. The challenge is to classify which students would successfully finish the program and which would not. The students who are most likely not to finish the program successfully should be warned that their decision is not necessarily the best decision for them, and they should consider some other possibilities. This paper proposes one possible criterion for the given challenge: we will develop a machine learning model with the collected data from high schools which the students have attended prior to Algebra and calculate the probability of not finishing the program successfully. Students who would be classified by the model as unsuccessful will receive recommendation for another study program. © 2020 Croatian Society MIPRO.",Higher education student; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Student retention,Machine learning; Turing machines; Best decision; Drop-out; Empirical data; High school; High school students; Machine learning models; Most likely; Transition from high school to university; Students,"Brase C.H., Pellillo Brase C., Understanding Basic Statistics, Enhanced, (2016); Hosmer D.W., Lemeshow S., Sturdivant R.X., Applied Logistic Regression, 398, (2013); Kucak D., Juricic V., Dambic G., Machine learning in education-A survey of current research trends, Annals of Daaam & Proceedings, 29, (2018); Burnham K., Anderson D., Model Selection and Multi-model Inference 2nd Edn, (2002); Buckland M., Gey F., The relationship between recall and precision, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 45, 1, pp. 12-19, (1994); Ounpraseuth S., Et al., Estimating misclassification error: A closer look at cross-validation based methods, Bmc Research Notes, 5, 1, (2012); Anzanello M.J., Sanson Fogliatto F., Learning curve models and applications: Literature review and research directions, International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 41, 5, pp. 573-583, (2011); Chi J.T., Chi E.C., Getting to the Bottom of Regression with Gradient Descent"" Statistics Views, (2014); Weisstein E.W., Sigmoid Function, (2002)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097232941,,

These include student tutoring, mentoring, recovery classes, summer school, etc. Being able to identify the borderline cases is extremely important for planning and intervening in time. This position paper reports on an ongoing project, being developed at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD), which uses the students’ data and artificial intelligence algorithms to create models and predict the performance of students and classes. The main objective of the IA.EDU project is to research the usage of data, artificial intelligence and data science to create artificial intelligence solutions, including models and applications, to provide predictive information that can contribute to the increase in students’ academic success and a reduction in the dropout rate, by making it possible to act proactively with the students at risk, course directors and course designers. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic performance; Artificial intelligence; Data science; Higher education; Prediction and inference,Data Science; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Students; Academic performance; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Higher education institutions; Higher education students; Position papers; Predictive information; Summer school; Artificial intelligence,"Li K.F., Rusk D., Song F., Predicting student academic performance, 2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, pp. 27-33; Azmi M., Paris I., Academic performance prediction based on voting technique, IEEE International Conference on Communication Software and Networks, pp. 24-27, (2011); Nghe N.T., Janecek P., Haddawy P., A comparative analysis of techniques for predicting academic performance, 37Th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. 7-12, (2007); Jackson J.E., A User’s Guide to Principal Components, (2003); Marquez-Vera C., Cano A., Romero C., Et al., Appl.

Student dropouts in higher education institutions, such as universities, often result in an increase in tutors’ workload. Currently, educational assistance is focused on supporting the students’ learning, and the main purpose of this assistance is an acceleration of the learning process. Although student assistance is undoubtedly of great importance, offering assistance to teachers who also have a tutoring role is equally important. The purpose of our framework for assistance is to detect students at risk for dropout, after which an alert is sent to the tutors. The alert encourages tutors to take timely action to avoid student dropouts.

Academically, there are learning problems and these are directly related to the dropout rate, which brings financial problems. Added to this are the economic problems caused by the pandemic, where the rates of students who want to access a private education have dropped considerably. For this reason, it is necessary for all private universities to have support to improve their student income and avoid cuts in budgets and resources. However, the academic part represents a great effort to fulfill their academic activities, which are the priority, with attention on those interested in pursuing a training programs. To solve these problems, it is important to integrate technologies such as Chatbots, which use artificial intelligence in such a way that tasks such as providing information on an academic courses are addressed by them, reducing the administrative burden and improving the user experience. At the same time, this encourages people to be a part of the college. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the number of students who actually graduate remains low. Some studies show that this is due to a phenomenon called retention, consisting of a student taking more time to graduate than the minimum required by the program, which may lead to late graduation. Hence, identifying retention patterns in an undergraduate program may assist the universities in anticipating the entrance of qualified professionals in the job market, while lessening the students’ dropout rate. Undergraduate programs and grade reports can be represented by DAGs, in which each course (as a task to be accomplished by each student) is represented as a vertex, and relations between courses are represented as edges. This article proposes methods for mining DAGs using statistical analysis and Apriori-based concepts, to identify retention patterns in undergraduate programs. This work also presents an experimental analysis using real data from Fluminense Federal University, a Brazilian public higher education institution, for evaluating the methods. © 2019",Educational mining; Graph mining; Undergraduate program,Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Direct acyclic graphs; Educational datum; Experimental analysis; Graph mining; Higher education institutions; Job market; Undergraduate program; Undergraduate students; Students,"Aggarwal C.C., Wang H., Managing and Mining Graph Data, (2010); Agrawal R., Mannila H., Srikant R., Toivonen H., Verkamo A.I., Et al., Fast discovery of association rules., Adv.

Predictive learning analytics examines the learning data for intervening or improving the process itself that positively reflects on student performance. In our survey, we are considering the most recent research papers focusing on predictive learning analytics and how that affects the final student outcome in educational institutions. The process of predictive learning analytics, such as data collection, data preprocessing, data mining, and others, has been illustrated in detail. We have identified factors that affect student performance. Several machine learning approaches have also been compared to provide a clear view of the most suitable algorithms and tools used for implementing the learning analytics.  © 2020 IEEE.",Data mining; Educational Data Mining; Higher education institutions; Predictive Learning Analytics; Student performance,Data acquisition; Data mining; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Data preprocessing; Educational institutions; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Machine learning approaches; Recent researches; Student performance; Student retention; Students,"Amara A., Deborah R., Ayse B., Mauricio M., Learning analytics in higher education: A summary of tools and approaches, 30th ascilite Conference, (2013); Rahila U., Teo S., Anuradha M., Suriadi S., A learning analytics approach: Using online weekly student engagement data to make predictions on student performance, International Conference on Computing, Electronic and Electrical Engineering (ICE Cube, (2018); Al-Azawei A., What drives successful social media in education and e-learning?

Institutions need to be able to measure and reduce dropout rates. Currently, annual expenses with dropout reach R$ 415 million in Brazilian currency. The purpose of this article is to identify the factors that affect students who drop out of the University of Brasilia (UnB) and Machine Learning to provide a model for predicting which students will drop out of undergraduate courses. With this, actions can be taken to reduce the dropout rate. The result of this work demonstrates that the courses with the most credits (workload), longer time to complete (5–6 year courses) and student’s poorer academic performance (poor grades) influences student dropout rate. Also, social factors, such as quota holders or non-quota holders, also influence the dropout rate of undergraduate students at the University of Brasília (UnB). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Academic performance; Apriori; CRISP-DM; Educational data mining; Machine learning,Data mining; Drops; Academic performance; Drop-out; Educational institutions; Social factor; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Students,"Aiello S., Eckstrand E., Fu A., Landry M., Aboyoun P., Machine Learning with R and H2O.

Deep learning based fault diagnosis methods have achieved great success. However, the features extracted by different models may vary resulting in ambiguous representation of the data, and even wasted time with manually selecting the optimal hyperparameters. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a new framework named Ensemble Sparse Supervised Model (ESSM), in which a typical deep learning model is treated as two phases of feature learning and model learning. In the feature learning phase, the original data is represented to be a feature matrix as non-redundant as possible by applying sparse filtering. Then, the feature matrix is fed into the model learning phase. Regularization, dropout and rectified linear unit (ReLU) are used in the model's neurons and layers to build a sparse deep neural network. Finally, the output of the sparse deep neural network provides feedback to the first phase to obtain better sparse features. In the proposed method, hyperparameters need to be pre-specified and a python library of talos is employed to finish the process automatically. The proposed method is verified using the bearing data provided by Case Western Reserve University. The result demonstrates that the proposed method can capture the effective pattern of data with the help of sparse constraints and simultaneously provide convenience for the operators with assuring performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; Sparse representation,Agricultural robots; Bearings (machine parts); Deep neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Flow control; Learning systems; Manufacture; Matrix algebra; Multilayer neural networks; Bearing fault diagnosis; Case Western Reserve University; Fault diagnosis method; Feature learning; Feature matrices; Hyperparameters; Machinery fault diagnosis; Smart manufacturing; Deep learning,"Lu Y., Xu X., Cloud-based manufacturing equipment and big data analytics to enable on-demand manufacturing services, Robot.

This paper investigates role, application, and challenges of applying AI to predict the academic performance traditional of students: dropouts, GPA, publication activity and other indicators to decrease dropouts and make the learning process more personalized and adaptive. In the first part, we overview the process of data mining using internal university's resources (LMS and other systems) and open source data from students' social networks. Such an aggregation allows describing each student by socio-demographic and psychometric features. Further, we demonstrate how we can dynamically monitor students' activities during the learning process to supplement the resulting features. In the second part of our research, we propose various static and dynamic targets for predictive models and demonstrate the results of predictions and comparisons of several predictive models. The research is based on the information on data processing of more than 20000 students in 2013-2019. © 2020 ACM.",Artificial Intelligence; Educational Analytics; Learning analytics; Smart University,Data mining; Education computing; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Open systems; Predictive analytics; Robotics; Turing machines; Academic performance; Educational systems; Higher education institutions; Learning process; Machine learning approaches; Open source datum; Predictive models; Publication activities; Students,"Agarwal A., Xie B., Vovsha I., Rambow O., Passonneau R., Sentiment analysis of twitter data, Proceedings of the Workshop on Languages in Social Media.

This is especially true when the institutions are funded through public resources. In order to minimize evasion losses, socioeconomic policies and programs were created to assist and support actions seeking to maximize the number of students that graduate in a suitable program time. This work presents a methodology that aims to predict evasion by using machine learning. Our approach was able to classify student abandonment with an average f-score and accuracy results above 95%. Our approach combines a decision tree alongside a genetic algorithm and cluster stratified sampling. The results obtained show that students with a Grade Point Average (GPA) below 5.79 and that have been enrolled for more than a year require careful monitoring because they tend to exceed the program duration time or abandon it. Furthermore, approximately one-third of all identified dropouts students occurred in the first year. © 2020 IEEE.",dropout; evolutionary computation; features selection; higher education; machine learning,Decision trees; Genetic algorithms; Image processing; Losses; Trees (mathematics); Degree program; Duration time; Financial loss; First year; Grade point average; Higher education students; Public resources; Stratified sampling; Students,"Andriola W.B., Evasao Discente Na Universidade Federal Do Ceara (Ufc): Proposta para Identificar Suas Causas e Irnplantar Urn Servi O de Orienta Ao e InforRNA Ao (Soi), 40, pp. 332-347, (2003); Ao Superior-notas Estisticas 2016.

We develop an early detection system (EDS) using administrative student data from a state and private university to predict student dropout as a basis for a targeted intervention. To create an EDS that can be used in any German university, we use the AdaBoost Algorithm to combine regression analysis, neural networks, and decision trees - instead of relying on only one specific method. Prediction accuracy at the end of the first semester is 79% for the state university and 85% for the private university of applied sciences. After the fourth semester, the accuracy improves to 90% for the state university and 95% for the private university of applied sciences. © 2019 Authors.

The main objective is two-fold: (1) gain a comprehensive understanding of how the existing curriculum has been supporting (or hindering) students' progress towards graduation; and (2) suggest data-informed curricular changes. To this end, we utilize both explorative statistical analysis and data mining/machine learning approaches to first learn how individual courses and the prescribed course sequences influence a student's dropout/graduation status, and then build machine learning models to interpret/validate the observed interdependency among key courses in the current curriculum. Such patterns/models are consequently utilized to suggest impactful curricular changes towards reducing early dropouts and improving the overall student success as measured by graduation with a CS degree. One main finding of this research is that a successful CS student needs to excel in both critical thinking and core CS skills. To help students gain critical thinking skills, it is essential to strengthen the presence of mathematics and physics courses in the CS curriculum. Furthermore, our results suggest that CS students without a solid math foundation before starting their college career should complete a remedial math course earlier than putting it off for later. Moreover, before students advance to the second half of their CS study to gain core CS knowledge/skills (e.g., operating systems), they should complete the required physics class. Finally, we observe that it is necessary to introduce new prerequisite requirements among upper-level CS courses, for example, Operating Systems as a prerequisite to an upper-level CS core course on programming theories.  © 2021 IEEE.",computer science curriculum; data mining; engineering curriculum; machine learning; statistical analysis,Curricula; Data mining; Education computing; Engineering education; Machine learning; Students; Computer science curricula; Computer science students; Curricular changes; Engineering curriculum; Graduation rates; Performance data; Research papers; San Francisco; Student performance; Systematic analysis; Statistical methods,"Webber D.A., Are college costs worth it?

This delay is called retention, which can lead to program abandonment. STEM undergraduate programs, in particular, have higher retention and dropout rates when compared to other non-STEM programs. The students in such programs end up exchanging or dropping out the programs before graduating, causing waste in economic, social and academic terms. In this context, Recommendation Systems can be used to support students and managers in choosing disciplines, contributing for them achieving better academic performance and thus aiming to improve student learning and engagement and mitigate retention. For constructing these Recommendation Systems, Educational Data Mining techniques, including machine learning algorithms, can be used to identify and predict retention situations and contribute to reducing their occurrence. The aim of this paper is to present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for identifying the use of Educational Data Mining methodologies, techniques and tools to implement Recommendation Systems with a focus on preventing student retention in higher education programs. We selected studies available in digital libraries that are international references in publications of scientific articles, in order to answer the following research question: What machine learning methods were used in Recommendation Systems in the context of Educational Data Mining? Among the various studies found to reduce student retention rates, most used methods to predict student grades. We observed that there are many papers proposing the use of machine learning methods for predicting failure in disciplines, either through regressors or classifiers. However, just a few studies have proposed Recommendation Systems to assist students in choosing subjects at the time of enrollment for the next term, which indicates a large area for the development of further future work in this field.  © 2021 IEEE.",Educational Data Mining; Machine Learning; Recommendation Systems; Retention in Higher Education,Data mining; Digital libraries; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Students; Academic performance; Educational data mining; Expected time; High educations; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Retention in high education; STEM program; Student retention; Undergraduate projects; Recommender systems,"Campello A.D.V.C., Lins L.N., Metodologia de análise e tratamento da evasão e retenção em cursos de graduação de instituições federais de ensino superior, XXVIII Encontro Nacional de Engenharia de Produção, RJ, (2008); Sithole A., Chiyaka E.T., McCarthy P., Mupinga D.M., Bucklein B.K., Kibirige J., Student attraction, persistence and retention in stem programs: Successes and continuing challenges, Higher Education Studies, 7, 1, pp. 46-59, (2017); Silva Filho R.L.L., Motejunas P.R., Hipolito O., Lobo M.B.D.C.M., A evasão no ensino superior brasileiro, Cadernos de Pesquisa, 37, 132, pp. 641-659, (2007); Baker R., Isotani S., Carvalho A., Mineraçao de dados educacionais: Oportunidades para o brasil, Revista Brasileira de Informática Na Educação, 19, 2, (2011); Ricci F., Rokach L., Shapira B., Introduction to recommender systems handbook, Recommender Systems Handbook, pp. 1-35, (2011); Lu L., Medo M., Yeung C.H., Zhang Y.-C., Zhang Z.-K., Zhou T., Recommender systems, Physics Reports, 519, 1, pp. 1-49, (2012); Almutairi F.M., Sidiropoulos N.D., Karypis G., Context-aware recommendation-based learning analytics using tensor and coupled matrix factorization, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 11, 5, pp. 729-741, (2017); Moreno-Marcos P., Alario-Hoyos C., Munoz-Merino P.J., Kloos C., Prediction in moocs: A review and future research directions, IEEE Trans Learning Tech, 12, 3, pp. 384-401, (2018); Bin Mat U., Buniyamin N., Arsad P.M., Kassim R., An overview of using academic analytics to predict and improve students' achievement: A proposed proactive intelligent intervention, Proc 2013 IEEE 5th Conf Engineering Education (ICEED).

The turnover rate is difficult to predict and challenging to manage, therefore, having a warning system or tool that predicts possible resignations at an early stage may help HR managers improve their retention strategies and maintain a stable rate. The main target for this research proposal is to build a model based on HR managers observations and knowledge alongside theoretical assumptions using historical data to assist decision-making. The model will be built, constructed, and developed using machine learning and system dynamics to act as a predictive tool. Therefore, HR managers will be able to predict the turnover rate and most importantly to identify the reasons behind it, thus, they will have more flexibility in adjusting and improving retention strategies. To build this predictive model, mixed methods qualitative and quantitative will be used taking into consideration the ethical approval process of data gathering by the university of Worcester.

While research has been conducted around topics such as attrition, retention, and educational data mining, one of the hardest questions to answer is what effect does a student's schedule have on their success? This question is hard to address given the amount of variables around what makes a good schedule for any given student and the inherent heterogeneity of students. Institutions of higher education happen to capture a tremendous amount of data around a student, whether it is intentional or not. This paper presents a design theoretic approach to seizing the opportunity this data to create a smart advising system while removing a human element of error. © 2020 26th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2020.

These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students' activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students' knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students' performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students' performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others. © 2020 by the authors.",Artificial neural networks; Collaborative filtering; Deep learning; Dropout; Machine learning; Prediction; Recommender systems; Students' performance; Supervised learning; Unsupervised learning,,"Han J., Kamber M., Pei J., Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, (2011); Kotsiantis S., Pierrakeas C., Pintelas P., Predicting Students' Performance in Distance Learning using Machine Learning Techniques, Appl.

It is responsible for at least 25% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States alone. Accurate and early diagnosis of this form of cancer can increase the rate of survival. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is one of the most accurate techniques for diagnosing the disease. In order to improve the classification accuracy of pulmonary lesions indicating lung cancer, this paper presents an improved method for training a densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet). The optimized setting ensures that code prediction error and reconstruction error within hidden layers are simultaneously minimized. To achieve this and improve the classification accuracy of the DenseNet, we propose an improved predictive sparse decomposition (PSD) approach for extracting sparse features from the medical images. The sparse decomposition is achieved by using a linear combination of basis functions over the L2 norm. The effect of dropout and hidden layer expansion on the classification accuracy of the DenseNet is also investigated. CT scans of human lung samples are obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) hosted by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The proposed method outperforms seven other neural network architectures and machine learning algorithms with a classification accuracy of 95%.

More often than not, the reasons for students not completing their degree in the allocated time frame include academic reasons, socio-pschyo factors, and lack of effective transition from the secondary education system to the tertiary education systems. To overcome these challenges, the tertiary educational institutions endeavor to implement interventions geared toward academic success. One of the challenges, however, is identifying the vulnerable students in a timely manner. This study therefore aims to predict student performance by using a learner attrition model so that the vulnerable students are identified early on in the academic year and are provided support through effective interventions, thereby impacting student success positively. Predictive machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and logistic regression, were trained to deduce the students into four risk-profiles. A random forest outperformed other classifiers in predicting at-risk student profiles with an accuracy of 85%, kappa statistic of 0.7, and an AUC of 0.95. This research argues for a more complex view of predicting vulnerable learners by including the student's background, individual, and schooling attributes. © 2020 IEEE.",At-risk; Attrition; Classification; Machine learning,Decision trees; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Attrition models; Conceptual model; Education systems; Higher education institutions; Machine learning methods; Student performance; Tertiary education; Tertiary educational institutions; Students,"Kuzilek J., Hlosta M., Herrmannova D., Zdrahal Z., Wolff A., Ou analyse: Analysing at-risk students at the open university, Learning Analytics Review, pp. 1-16, (2015); Johnson R.A., Gong R., Greatorex-Voith S., Anand A., Fritzler A., A data-driven framework for identifying high school students at risk of not graduating on time, Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange Conf, 5, (2015); Dell M., Dell S., A Brief Guide to Recreational Pyromania, (2019); Anand P., Herrington A., Agostinho S., Constructivist-based learning using location-aware mobile technology: An exploratory study, EdMedia+ Innovate Learning, pp. 2312-2316, (2008); Abed T., Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., A prediction model to improve student placement at a South African higher education institution, 2020 International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference, pp. 1-6, (2020); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Cross M., Carpentier C., new students' in South African higher education: Institutional culture, student performance and the challenge of democratisation, Perspectives in Education, 27, 1, pp. 6-18, (2009); Mwamwenda T.S., Gender differences in scores on test anxiety and academic achievement among South African university graduate students, South African Journal of Psychology, 24, 4, pp. 228-230, (1994); Ajoodha R., Jadhav A., Dukhan S., Forecasting learner attrition for student success at a South African university, Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists 2020 (SAICSIT '20), September 14-16, 2020, Cape Town, South Africa.

In this paper, our principal contribution is to provide an expert system that statistically predicts the success of a first year student in an undergraduate Science programme given only academic merit in their subject matter. Over the past decades, much work has been done in the field of predicting student success in first year computer science and in other first year courses. Historically, other authors focused on using linear statistical models to predict student success. These models had limitations as the prediction was designed for inference as compared to machine learning techniques. This paper presents an approach of using the naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machines and decision trees as models that can be used to predict the completion of an undergraduate science degree. This was done by firstly training the classifiers and then testing them. The support vector machine achieved the best accuracy (87%) in predicting the completion of a science degree based only on first year marks, this was followed by the naïve Bayes model (86.36%) and the decision tree (65.62%) came last. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Most of the predictive models developed for those key outcomes have been based on traditional methodological approaches. However, these models assume linear relationships between variables and do not always yield accurate predictive classifications. On the other hand, the use of machine-learning approaches such as artificial neural networks has been very effective in the classification of various educational outcomes, overcoming the limitations of traditional methodological approaches. In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network models, with a backpropagation algorithm, were developed to classify levels of grade point average, academic retention, and degree completion outcomes in a sample of 655 students from a private university. Findings showed a high level of accuracy for all the classifications. Among the predictors, learning strategies had the greatest contribution for the prediction of grade point average.

Several factors need to be corrected, and others eliminated so that students can to have access to higher education and guarantee the completion of their courses. Motivation: finding the best model to predict a specific problem is not a simple task. It's because the phenomena involved are not known, or are sophisticated modeling. Thus, combining models often produces better accuracy than individual models. Different models use this combination approach and have been applied in the context of Data Mining (MD), for prediction and classification. Objective: we propose in this study three different models to predict school dropout. These are based on Ensemble Regression. We apply the models in the context of the Brazilian Higher Education Institutions. Besides, it may help in the identification of the factors associated with dropout. For this, we used two techniques for the attribute selection: Stepwise and Pearson correlation. That techniques determine the factors related to dropout. Methodology: we used the data from the Census and Flow Indicators Higher Education. The methodology is based on CRISP-DM to understand, prepare, and model the data. We used predictive bagging methods to make a model to predict dropout. Results: the ensemble regression models proposed obtained better performance compared model literature. The ensemble model based on bagging of linear regression had a smaller prediction error. Besides, the models proposed in this study will help the educational administrators and policymakers working within the educational sector in the development of new policies that are relevant to student retention. But, the global implications of this research to practice is its ability to help in early identifying factories associated with students at risk of dropout of High Education. © 2019 IEEE.",Bagging; Data Mining; Ensemble Models; Machine Learning; Prediction,Correlation methods; Data mining; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Students; Attribute selection; Bagging; Combination approaches; Educational administrators; Educational sectors; Ensemble models; Higher education institutions; Pearson correlation; Education computing,"Romero C., Ventura C., Educational Data Mining: A Review of the State of the Art, pp. 601-618, (2010); Himanshu Singh A.D., Pudi V., Pager: Parameterless, Accurate, Generic, Eficient Knn-based Regression, pp. 168-176, (2010); Douglas Montgomery C.E.A.P., Vining G.G., Introduction to linear regression analysis, 2018 IEEE 1st Colombian Conference on Applications in Computational Intelligence (ColCACI); Ozcift A., Forward stage-wise ensemble regression algorithm to improve base regressors prediction ability: An empirical study, Expert Systems, pp. 1-8, (2014); Kotsiantis S.B., Combining bagging and additive regression, Int J ComputMath Sci, pp. 61-67, (2007); Kuncheva L.I., Ombining pattern classfiers: Methods and algorithms, Int J ComputMath Sci, (2004); Chapman P., Clinton J., Kerber R., Khabaza T., Reinartz T., Shearer C., Wirth R., Crisp-dm 1. 0 Step-by-step Data Mining Guide, (2000); Kantorski G., Flores E.G., Schmitt J., Hoffmann I., Barbosa F., Prediçao da evasao em cursos de graduaçao em instituiçoes públicas, Brazilian Symposium on Computers in Education (Simpósio Brasileiro de Informática Na Educação-SBIE), 27, 1, (2016); Fritsch R., Da Rocha C.S., Vitelli R.F., A evasão nos cursos de graduação em uma instituição de ensino superior privada, Revista Educação em Questão, 52, 38, pp. 81-108, (2015); Perez B., Castellanos C., Correal D., Applying data mining techniques to predict student dropout: A case study, 2018 IEEE 1st Colombian Conference on Applications in Computational Intelligence (ColCACI).

These 3000+ students were enrolled in a community-based learning program between 2014 and 2018 at San Francisco State University, a 4-year public degree-granting university. To address the ongoing challenge of low retention and graduation rates, this program has introduced early and preventative interventions through both mandatory and voluntary advising with a team of 40+ advisors. We apply statistical and machine learning approaches to analyze the advising records generated over a period of 5 years. Specifically, we have addressed the following problems: (1) what is the impact of timing and frequency of advising interactions on students' retention and graduation status? (2) how effective are such interactions in helping academically at-risk students? (3) What are the common types of interactions and how are they correlated with students' academic performance? Finally, (4) how much insight can we further gain through looking into advisors' written notes? Our results show that the current advising practice is not biased against a specific demographic group. They also show that it is important to require advising during a student's first term of her college career. Delaying such interactions to the second term, for instance, can significantly lower the likelihood to retain students in their third term and then seventh term, consequently reducing their chance to graduate within four or five years. Finally, after having applied a host of natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., LDA topic modeling) to advisors' written notes, the results suggest that a more rigorous note-taking approach is needed in order for such notes to help gain broader and deeper insights into students' advising needs.

This paper presents Grätzelbot, a chatbot designed to help with onboarding freshmen by means of connecting them in a network-building 12-day scavenger hunt. The onboarding concept that led to Grätzelbot was developed in a participatory design process together with students, and implemented during the start of the semester with more than 100 participants. The evaluation results revealed that the students felt more familiar with the faculty building and the university campus after the scavenger hunt, also met other students, made new friends, and, by participating, their sense of belonging to the student community got stronger. As a social companion fostering relatedness among its users, Grätzelbot serves as an example for the reach and benefits of Social Software. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Chatbots; Companion technology; HCI; Social software,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Community buildings; Evaluation results; Faculty buildings; Participatory design; Retention rate; Sense of belonging; Social software; University campus; Students,"Biundo S., Holler D., Schattenberg B., Bercher P., Companion-technology: An overview, KI-Künstliche Intelligenz, 30, 1, pp. 11-20, (2016); Biundo S., Wendemuth A., Companion Technology.

The models are computed on the basis of examination data, i.e. data available at all universities without the need of specific collection. Therefore, we propose a methodical approach that may be put in practice with relative ease at other institutions. We find decision trees to produce slightly better results than logistic regressions. However, both methods yield high prediction accuracies of up to 95% after three semesters. A classification with more than 83% accuracy is already possible after the first semester. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Educational data mining; machine learning; retention management; student attrition; student dropout prediction,,"Aldrich J.H., Nelson F.D., Linear Probability, Logit, and Probit Models, 45, (1984); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Joshua B., Jevin W., (2016); Babyak M.A., What You See May Not Be What You Get: A Brief, non-Technical Introduction to Overfitting in Regression-Type Models, Psychosomatic Medicine, 66, 3, pp. 411-421, (2004); Caison A.L., Analysis of Institutionally Specific Retention Research: A Comparison Between Survey and Institutional Database Methods, Research in Higher Education, 48, 4, pp. 435-451, (2007); Chawla N.V., Bowyer K.W., Hall L.O., Kegelmeyer W.P., SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Chawla N.V., Cieslak D.A., Hall L.O., Joshi A., Automatically Countering Imbalance and Its Empirical Relationship to Cost, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 17, 2, pp. 225-252, (2008); Cohen J., A Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 10, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Dekker G.W., Pechenizkiy M., Vleeshouwers J.M., Predicting Students Drop out: A Case Study, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on educational data mining, pp. 41-50, (2009); Delen D., A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Student Retention Management, Decision Support Systems, 49, 4, pp. 498-506, (2010); Djulovic A., Li D., Towards Freshman Retention Prediction: A Comparative Study, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 3, 5, pp. 494-500, (2013); Gansemer-Topf A.M., Schuh J.H., Institutional Selectivity and Institutional Expenditures: Examining Organizational Factors That Contribute to Retention and Graduation, Research in Higher Education, 47, 6, pp. 613-642, (2006); Gwet K.L., Handbook of Inter-Rater Reliability: The Definitive Guide to Measuring the Extent of Agreement among Raters, (2014); Hetze P., (2011); Heublein U., (2010); Heublein U., (2014); Heublein U., Spangenberg H., Sommer D., (2003); Kennedy P., A Guide to Econometrics, (2003); Kovacic Z., Early Prediction of Student Success: Mining Students’ Enrolment Data, pp. 647-665, (2010); Kuhn M., Wing J., Weston S., Williams A., Keefer C., Engelhardt A., Cooper T., Et al., (2016); Landis J.R., Koch G.G., The Measurement of Observer Agreement for Categorical Data, Biometrics, pp. 159-174, (1977); Menard S., Applied Logistic Regression Analysis: Sage University Series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences, (1995); Milborrow S., (2017); Obrien R.M., A Caution Regarding Rules of Thumb for Variance Inflation Factors, Quality & Quantity, 41, 5, pp. 673-690, (2007); Office F.L., (2017); Peduzzi P., Concato J., Kemper E., Holford T.R., Feinstein A.R., A Simulation Study of the Number of Events per Variable in Logistic Regression Analysis, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 49, 12, pp. 1373-1379, (1996); Piramuthu S., Input Data for Decision Trees, Expert Systems with Applications, 34, 2, pp. 1220-1226, (2008); Ram S., Wang Y., Currim S.A., Currim F.A., (2018); Song Y.-Y., Ying L., Decision Tree Methods: Applications for Classification and Prediction, Shanghai Archives of Psychiatry, 27, 2, (2015); Spence M., Job Market Signaling, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, 3, pp. 355-374, (1973); Tinto V., Dropout From Higher Education: A Theoretical Synthesis of Recent Research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Yu C.H., DiGangi S., Jannasch-Pennell A., Kaprolet C., A Data Mining Approach for Identifying Predictors of Student Retention From Sophomore to Junior Year, Journal of Data Science, 8, 2, pp. 307-325, (2010); Yukselturk E., Ozekes S., Turel Y.K., Predicting Dropout Student: an Application of Data Mining Methods in an Online Education Program, European Journal of Open Distance and E-Learning, 17, 1, pp. 118-133, (2014); Zhang Y., Oussena S., Clark T., Kim H., Using Data Mining to Improve Student Retention in Higher Education: A Case Study, International Conference on Enterprise information systems, (2010)","L.

Various algorithms have been employed to measure student's GPA in the next semester's courses. The results can be used to early identify dropout students or help students choose the elective courses which are appropriate for them. Some of the most widely used methods for predicting students performance in their future courses are based on techniques frequently used in Recommender System such as Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization. Consequently, the prediction method can affect the accuracy of the prediction results. However, the characteristics of the dataset also have a large impact on the performance of the corresponding prediction model. In this paper, we will analyze Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT) dataset which consists of information about undergraduate students from 2006 to 2017 by conducting various experiments on two distinct faculties using multiple types of collaborative filtering, matrix factorization or the combination of both methods. The results show that the characteristics of the dataset can greatly influence the outcome of the prediction models. By carefully choosing and manipulating the input data, we improve the accuracy of the prediction model by over 30% in some cases. © 2019 IEEE.",distributed system; Educational Data Mining; machine learning; prediction; Spark; student performance,Collaborative filtering; Data mining; Factorization; Forecasting; Large dataset; Matrix algebra; Predictive analytics; Educational data minings (EDM); Educational institutions; Elective course; Input datas; Matrix factorizations; Prediction methods; Prediction model; Undergraduate students; Students,"Romero C., Ventura S., Educational data mining: A review of the state of the art, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, 40, pp. 601-618, (2010); Chrysafiadi K., Virvou M., Student modeling approaches: A literature review for the last decade, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 11, pp. 4715-4729, (2013); Baker R.S., Yacef K., The state of educational data mining in 2009: A review and future visions, Journal of Educational Data Mining, 1, pp. 601-618, (2009); Zimmermann J., Brodersen K.H., Pellet J.-P., August E., Buhmann J., Predicting Graduate-level Performance from Undergraduate Achievements, pp. 357-358, (2011); Cristobal Romero P.G.E., Ventura S., Hervas C., Data mining algorithms to classify students, 1st International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 8-17, (2008); Conijn R., Snijders C., Kleingeld A., Matzat U., Predicting student performance from lms data: A comparison of 17 blended courses using moodle lms, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, (2017); Nurjanah D., Good and similar learners' recommendation in adaptive learning systems, Conference on Computer Supported Education, 1, pp. 434-440, (2016); Turnip R., Nurjanah D., Kusumo D., Hybrid Recommender System for Learning Material Using Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering with Good Learners' Rating, pp. 61-66, (2017); Iqbal Z., Qadir J., Mian A.N., Kamiran F., Machine Learning Based Student Grade Prediction: A Case Study, (2017); Thainghe N., Drumond L., Krohn-Grimberghe A., Schmidt-Thieme L., Recommender system for predicting student performance, Procedia Computer Science, 1, pp. 2811-2819, (2010); Thainghe N., Drumond L., Nanopoulos R., Schmidt-Thieme L., Recommender system for predicting student performance, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Computer Supported Education (CSEDU), (2011); Feng M., Heffernan N., Koedinger K., Addressing the assessment challenge with an online system that tutors as it assesses, User Model.

In the past 10 years, millions of dollars have gone into all levels of STEM education from primary school to university and there has been an exponential growth in the number of diversity and inclusion programs. However, the career outlook for STEM minority students has yet to improve; Hispanic and Black people continue being the most underrepresented groups in the tech sector. With recent events, the lack of diversity at all corporate levels of the technology sector has come under the microscope. Current hiring strategies continue to fail minority groups. One major problem we found was that minority populations are invited to participate in technical conferences but mostly as observers and not as subject matter experts who can contribute to the discussion. The goal of this paper is to propose solutions that allow historically marginalized populations to take their equitable place as intellectual contributors in the technology sector and increase the perceived perspectives from a potential idea of diversity window dressing to comply with federal mandates to a true intellectual boon in the economic work space. We propose three solutions: the diversification of available data sets; the creation of equity in the conference marketplace of ideas; and the preparation of conference spaces for the historically marginalized to participation.

Early prediction can help the university to take actions that help students to graduate on time and have the best learning outcomes. It also helps the universities to save billions of dollars spent on students who fail, change major or dropout. In this paper, we report our work in student performance prediction using 15 classification algorithms. The experimental results show that we were able to predict students' final GPA with 91% accuracy for two models Naive Bayes and Hoeffding tree which significantly outperform competitive models across different datasets. The average accuracy for all the 15 classifiers was around 71%. We also analyzed the rules generated by tree-based and rule-based classifiers and found that some courses at early levels can have a major effect on the final GPA. In comparison to other works in the field, we were able to have more comprehensive analysis that produced better accuracy with higher variation of class values. These results show the potential for data mining to improve students' success rate by informing who are at risk in order for Instructors and administrators to provide the necessary support at the right time. © 2020 Editura Academiei Romane.

The composition of the goal consists of 3 main points, including summarizing the situation from the past to the present, statistical analysis and machine learning analysis. Data collection is 1,888 students from the Department of Business Computer at University of Phayao from the academic year 2001–2016. The research tools are percentages, decision tree, cross-validation methods, and confusion matrix performance. The results showed that the dropout rate of learners in business computer program tended to increase even though the number of new students decreased. It was found that the academic results had a significant influence on dropout, which most of the students who dropped out were obviously in their first academic year. Which, the model received is a high-performance prediction level with an accuracy of 87.21%. It was found that factors affecting the dropout consisted of seven courses: 221110, 221120, 001103, 128221, 005171, 122130 and 128221. Based on research findings, it represents a situation that has entered into a crisis in which the stakeholders need to focus on the above problems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Analysis dropout situation; Educational data mining; Personal learning pathway; Student dropout prediction,Decision trees; Students; Confusion matrices; Cross-validation methods; Data collection; Performance prediction; Research tools; Education computing,"Mahoney M.H., An academic librarian’s search for meaning: A survey of lifelong learning in library literature, J.

This study investigates students’ interaction and learning with an AI book, which enables the inputting of questions and receiving of suggested questions to understand biology, in comparison with a traditional E-book. Students (n = 16) in a tertiary biology course engaged with the topics of energy in cells and cell signaling. The AI book group (n = 6) interacted with the AI book first followed by the E-book, while the E-book group (n = 10) did so in reverse. Students responded to pre-/posttests and to cognitive load, motivation, and usability questionnaires; and three students were interviewed. All interactions with the books were automatically logged. Results revealed a learning gain and a similar pattern of feature use across both books. Nevertheless, asking questions with the AI book was associated with higher retention and correlated positively with viewing visual representations more often. Students with a higher intrinsic motivation to know and to experience stimulation perceived book usability more favorably. Interviews revealed that posing and receiving suggested questions was helpful, while ideas for future development included more personalized feedback. Future research shall explore how learning can be benefitted with the AI-enriched book. © The Author(s) 2020.",artificial intelligence; biology learning; cognitive load; digital textbooks; motivation;

Constant monitoring of student satisfaction levels is therefore crucial. Traditionally, students voice their opinions through official surveys organized by the universities. In addition to that, nowadays, social media and review websites such as “Rate my professors” are rich sources of opinions that should not be ignored. Automated mining of students’ opinions can be realized via aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). ABSA s is a sub-discipline of natural language processing (NLP) that focusses on the identification of sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) and aspects (sentiment targets) in a sentence. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for ABSA of free text reviews expressed in student opinion surveys in the Serbian language. Sentiment analysis was carried out at the finest level of text granularity – the level of sentence segment (phrase and clause). Design/methodology/approach: The presented system relies on NLP techniques, machine learning models, rules and dictionaries. The corpora collected and annotated for system development and evaluation comprise students’ reviews of teaching staff at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and a corpus of publicly available reviews from the Serbian equivalent of the “Rate my professors” website. Findings: The research results indicate that positive sentiment can successfully be identified with the F-measure of 0.83, while negative sentiment can be detected with the F-measure of 0.94. While the F-measure for the aspect’s range is between 0.49 and 0.89, depending on their frequency in the corpus. Furthermore, the authors have concluded that the quality of ABSA depends on the source of the reviews (official students’ surveys vs review websites). Practical implications: The system for ABSA presented in this paper could improve the quality of service provided by the Serbian higher education institutions through a more effective search and summary of students’ opinions. For example, a particular educational institution could very easily find out which aspects of their service the students are not satisfied with and to which aspects of their service more attention should be directed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of ABSA carried out at the level of sentence segment for the Serbian language. The methodology and findings presented in this paper provide a much-needed bases for further work on sentiment analysis for the Serbian language that is well under-resourced and under-researched in this area. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Aspect-based sentiment mining;

Most often managers and academics alike rely on intuition and experience to identify the potential risk students and factors. This paper examines the literature surrounding current methods and measures in use in Learning Analytics. We find that while tools are available, they do not focus on earliest possible identification of struggling students. Our work defines a new descriptive statistic for student attendance and applies modern machine learning tools and techniques to create a predictive model. We demonstrate how students can be identified as early as week 3 (of the Fall semester) with approximately 97% accuracy. We, furthermore, situate this result within an appropriate pedagogical context to support its use as part of a more comprehensive student support mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Learning analytics; Machine learning; Student retention,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Students; Descriptive statistics; Higher education; Learning analytics; Predictive modeling; Student attendances; Student outcomes; Student retention; Student supports; Education computing,"Anderson T., Whittington C., Li X.J., Classes to passes: Is class attendance a determinant of grades in undergraduate engineering subjects?, AAEE2016 CONFERENCE coffs Harbour, Australia, (2016); Arnold K.E., Pistilli M.D., Course signals at purdue: Using learning analytics to increase student success, Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on learning analytics and knowledge, pp. 267-270, (2012); Baker R.S., Lindrum D., Lindrum M.J., Perkowski D., Analyzing early at-risk factors in higher education e-learning courses, Proceedings of the 8th international conference on educational data mining (EDM), pp. 150-155, (2015); Ball R., Wilkinson R., The use and abuse of performance indicators in UK higher education, Higher Education, 27, 4, pp. 417-427, (1994); Blackstone W., Commentaries on the laws of England, 4, (1830); Crede M., Roch S.G., Kieszczynka U.M., Class attendance in college: A meta-analytic review of the relationship of class attendance with grades and student characteristics, Review of Educational Research, 80, 2, pp. 272-295, (2010); Daniel B., Big data and analytics in higher education: Opportunities and challenges, British Journal of Educational Technology, 46, 5, pp. 904-920, (2015); Davis D., Altis consulting: He information management specialists presentation, (2015); DeBerard M.S., Spielmans G., Julka D., Predictors of academic achievement and retention among college freshmen: A longitudinal study, College Student Journal, 38, 1, pp. 66-80, (2004); Drachsler H., Greller W., Privacy and analytics: it's a delicate issue a checklist for trusted learning analytics, Proceedings of the sixth international conference on learning analytics & knowledge, pp. 89-98, (2016); Draper D., Gittoes M., Statistical analysis of performance indicators in UK higher education, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series a, 167, 3, pp. 449-474, (2004); Dringus L.P., Learning analytics considered harmful, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 16, 3, pp. 87-100, (2012); Fike D.S., Fike R., Predictors of first-year student retention in the community college, Community College Review, 36, 2, pp. 68-88, (2008); Frank E., Hall M.A.H., Witten I.H.; Gasevic D., Dawson S., Rogers T., Gasevic D., Learning analytics should not promote one size fits all: The effects of instructional conditions in predicting academic success, The Internet and Higher Education, 28, pp. 68-84, (2016); Gasevic D., Dawson S., Siemens G., Lets not forget: Learning analytics are about learning, TechTrends, 59, 1, pp. 64-71, (2015); Heaton-Shrestha C., May S., Burke L., Student retention in higher education: What role for virtual learning environments?, Journal of Further and Higher Education, 33, 1, pp. 83-92, (2009); Herodotou C., Rienties B., Boroowa A., Zdrahal Z., Hlosta M., Naydenova G., Implementing predictive learning analytics on a large scale: The teacher's perspective, Proceedings of the seventh international learning analytics & knowledge conference, LAK ’17, pp. 267-271, (2017); Hoel T., Chen W., Implications of the european data protection regulations for learning analytics design, Workshop paper accepted for presentation at the international workshop on learning analytics and educational data mining (LAEDM 2016) in conjunction with the international conference on collaboration technologies (CollabTech 2016), Kanazawa, Japan-September, pp. 14-16, (2016); Joshi M.V., On evaluating performance of classifiers for rare classes, EEE international conference on data mining, 2002.

In this investigation, we formulate models based on machine learning algorithms to extract relevant information predicting student retention at various levels, using higher education data and specifying the relevant variables involved in the modeling. Then, we utilize this information to help the process of knowledge discovery. We predict student retention at each of three levels during their first, second, and third years of study, obtaining models with an accuracy that exceeds 80% in all scenarios. These models allow us to adequately predict the level when dropout occurs. Among the machine learning algorithms used in this work are: decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, and support vector machines, of which the random forest technique performs the best. We detect that secondary educational score and the community poverty index are important predictive variables, which have not been previously reported in educational studies of this type. The dropout assessment at various levels reported here is valid for higher education institutions around the world with similar conditions to the Chilean case, where dropout rates affect the efficiency of such institutions. Having the ability to predict dropout based on student’s data enables these institutions to take preventative measures, avoiding the dropouts. In the case study, balancing the majority and minority classes improves the performance of the algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. What's more, most of the previous attempts to model attrition at traditional campuses using machine learning have focused on small, homogeneous groups of students. In this work, we model student attrition using a dataset that is composed almost exclusively of information routinely collected for record-keeping at a large, public US university. By examining the entirety of the university's student body and not a subset thereof, we use one of the largest known datasets for examining attrition at a public US university (N = 66,060). Our results show that students' second year re-enrollment and eventual graduation can be accurately predicted based on a single year of data (AUROCs = 0.887 and 0.811, respectively). We find that demographic data (such as race, gender, etc.) and pre-admission data (such as high school academics, entrance exam scores, etc.) - upon which most admissions processes are predicated - are not nearly as useful as early college performance/transcript data for these predictions. These results highlight the potential for data mining to impact student retention and success at traditional campuses. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

It is important to understand the time for acquisition and decay of knowledge and skills needed to manage rare and difficult clinical situations. Method Ten anaesthesiology residents underwent simulation-based education to manage a cannot intubate cannot ventilate scenario during general anaesthesia for caesarean section. Their performance was measured using an assessment tool and debriefed by two experienced anaesthesiologists. The parameters against which the performance was judged were grouped into preoperative assessment, preoperative patient care, equipment availability, induction sequence, communication and adherence to airway algorithm protocol. The scenario was repeated at 6 and 12 months thereafter. The residents' acquisition of knowledge, technical and non-Technical skills were assessed and compared at baseline, 6 months and end of 12 months. Result The skills of preoperative assessment, preoperative care and communication quickly improved but the specific skill of managing a difficult airway as measured by adherence to an airway algorithm required more than 6 months (CI at 6 vs 12 months:-3.4 to-0.81, p=0.016). The skills of preoperative assessment and preoperative care improved to a higher level quickly and were retained at this improved level. Communication (CI at 0 vs 6 months:-3.78 to-0.22, p=0.045 and at 6 vs 12 months:-3.39 to-1.49, p=0.007) and difficult airway management skill were slower to improve but continued to do so over the 12 months. The compliance to machine check was more gradual and showed an improvement at 12 months. Conclusion Our study is unique in analysing the learning curve characteristics of different components of a failed obstetric airway management skill. Repeated simulations over a longer period of time help in better reinforcement, retention of knowledge, recapitulation and implementation of technical and non-Technical skills. © ",airway; anesthesia; communication skills; patient simulation; postgraduate medical education,,"Searle R.D., Lyons G., Vanishing experience in training for obstetric general anaesthesia: An observational study, Int J Obstet Anesth, 17, pp. 233-237, (2008); Mushambi M.C., Kinsella S.M., Popat M., Et al., Obstetric anaesthetists? association and difficult airway Society guidelines for the management of difficult and failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics, Anaesthesia, 70, pp. 1286-1306, (2015); McGaghie W.C., Issenberg S.B., Barsuk J.H., Et al., A critical review of simulation-based mastery learning with translational outcomes, Med Educ, 48, pp. 375-385, (2014); RCOA, TRG-CCT-ANNEXB.pdf; Ortner C.M., Richebe P., Bollag L.A., Et al., Repeated simulation-based training for performing general anesthesia for emergency cesarean delivery: Long-Term retention and recurring mistakes, Int J Obstet Anesth, 23, pp. 341-347, (2014); Boet S., Borges B.C.R., Naik V.N., Et al., Complex procedural skills are retained for a minimum of 1 yr after a single high-fidelity simulation training session, Br J Anaesth, 107, pp. 533-539, (2011); Borges B.C.R., Boet S., Siu L.W., Et al., Incomplete adherence to the ASA difficult airway algorithm is unchanged after a high-fidelity simulation session, Can J Anaesth J Can Anesth, 57, pp. 644-649, (2010); Kuduvalli P.M., Jervis A., Tighe S.Q.M., Et al., Unanticipated difficult airway management in anaesthetised patients: A prospective study of the effect of mannequin training on management strategies and skill retention, Anaesthesia, 63, pp. 364-369, (2008); Scavone B.M., Sproviero M.T., McCarthy R.J., Et al., Development of an objective scoring system for measurement of resident performance on the human patient simulator, Anesthesiology, 105, pp. 260-266, (2006); Cindryani M., Widnyana I.M.G., Ignm A., Et al., Analysis of anesthesia chief resident competencies in anesthesia crisis management simulation, Adv Med Educ Pract, 2018, 9, pp. 847-853; Daga V., Angadi S.P., Failure of intravenous cannula one-way valve, Anaesthesia, 67, pp. 82-83, (2012); Wight J.M., King S., Fractured intravenous cannula, Anaesthesia, 69, pp. 1180-1181, (2014); Butcher J., Adekanye O., More leaky intravenous cannulae, Anaesthesia, 63, (2008); Krombach J.W., Edwards W.A., Marks J.D., Et al., Checklists and other cognitive AIDS for emergency and routine anesthesia Care-A survey on the perception of anesthesia providers from a large academic us institution, Anesth Pain Med, (2015); Jenkins B., Cognitive AIDS time for a change?, Anaesthesia, 69, pp. 660-664, (2014); Clay-Williams R., Colligan L., Back to basics: Checklists in aviation and healthcare, Bmj Qual Saf, 24, pp. 428-431, (2015); Aitkenhead A.R., Injuries associated with anaesthesia.

One of the common problems in a job sector or higher education is the evaluation of instructors’ performances in a course or employee’s performance in a job sector. The most widely applied method to evaluate the performance is through feedback of performance and details kept by the company or institution. In general, a classifier model can be built easily from many different methods and algorithms. The classifier system has been applied for predicting the employee performance using different machine learning techniques like SVM, random forest and decision tree system etc. The optimal performances of each of the algorithms are considered and prediction is made accordingly. Different features and attributes of employees that are essential in governing employees’ performance are extracted using feature extraction method. The datasets in the survey are found to be gathered from the HR analysis of specific company through HR datasets, questionnaires, feedback forms and the employee turnover probability is predicted. The effectiveness of these various models are calculated on the test data. After study of existing work, the outcomes and challenges are identified and conclusions are drawn accordingly. © 2020 SERSC.",Attrition; Data Analytics; Data Science; Employee Behaviour; Machine Learning; Performance,,"Punnoose R., Ajit P., Prediction of Employee Turnover in Organizations using Machine Learning Algorithms, (IJARAI) International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence, 9, (2016); Michael M., Mackay Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Research, Ball Hall 307C, the University of Memphis Joseph A.

Despite the extensive research and the implementation of various models to identify dropout causes and risk groups, few of them have been carried out in the Chilean higher education context.Our work attempts to identify, using machine learning methods, the variables with highest predictive value for student dropout by the end of the first year of study, within a 6-year Informatics Engineering programme with a rather high dropout rate of 21.9% reported on 2018. In that regard, we use the data of 4 cohorts of students (2012-2016) enrolled at the programme, to feed a random forest feature selection process. We later build a decision tree using the identified relevant features, which we later test using data of the 2017-2018 cohorts of students.Despite the fact that the decision tree is over-fitted (97,21% training accuracy against 81.01% test accuracy), the process sheds light on the nature of the variables that determine whether or not a student remains at the end of their first year of study at the University. 6 of the identified factors are academic, and the remaining one is social-cultural. © 2020 IEEE.",decision trees; first-year student dropout; random forest,Decision trees; Education computing; Engineering research; Informatics; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; First year students; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Machine learning methods; Predictive values; Relevant features; Significant variables; Training accuracy; Students,"Louis C., Attinasi P., Getting in: Mexican American students; Perceptions of their college-going behavior with implications for their freshman year persistence in the university"".

The casuistry that leads to dropout is different depending on the academic branches, the faculties or schools and the personal circumstances of the university students. The timing of this is also different. In a context of continuous changes and an excess of information, Universities consider the possibility of extracting early warning patterns from their databases that help to act in time in those cases where the probability of abandonment begins to be relatively high. This study proposes a two-stage methodology to extract such dropout patterns. In the first place, and depending on each faculty or university school, the model will extract the most influential factors on dropout and later, classification trees will be generated using these explanatory variables. The proposed methodology has been tested with real data from the University Miguel Hernández of Elche, with data from Degrees from the year 2010 to the present (24,894 records), provided directly by the Vice-Rector's Office for Students affairs and coordination. With the computational experience that accompanies the described methodology, predictive models are capable of modelling dropout with mean accuracies close to 80%. This not only offers a real photograph of the situation of each faculty, but is supported by more than enough confidence so that the Vice-Rector's Office can design contingency plans for scenarios where dropout is presented as a very likely alternative, in case of do not intervene early. © 2020 ACM.",classification; early warning; feature selection; Machine learning; students dropping,Ecosystems; Predictive analytics; Classification trees; College students; Contingency plans; Explanatory variables; Influential factors; Predictive models; University degree; University students; Students,"Shannon C.E., A mathematical theory of communication, The Bell System Technical Journal, 27, 623-656, pp. 379-423, (1948); Crisol Moya E., Romero Lopez M.A., Inclusive leadership as a strategy to avoid school leaving: Opinion of families, Educatio Siglo Xxi, 38, 2, pp. 45-66, (2015); Garcia A., Fuentes C.A., Abandono de los estudios universitarios: Dimensión, factores asociados y desafíos para la política pública, Revista Fuentes, 16, pp. 85-106, (2015); Liu J.B., Han J., A practical knowledge discovery process for distributed data mining. 11th international conference on intelligent systems -emerging technologies, Int Soc Comp & Their Applicat;, (2002); Breiman L., Friedman J., Stone C.J., Olshen R.A., Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Chapman P., Clinton J., Kerber R., Khabaza T., Khabaza T., Shearer C., Wirth R., CRISP-DM 1.0 Step by Step Data Mining Guide, (1999); Quinlan J.R., Inducción de árboles de decisión, Machine Learning, 1, 1, pp. 81-106, (1986); Spositto O.M., Etcheverry M., Ryckeboer H.L., Bossero J., Aplicación de técnicas de minería de datos para la evaluación del rendimiento académico y la deserción estudiantil, Memorias de la Novena Conferencia Iberoamericana de Sistemas.

Some students are permanently stopping going to school due to various reasons and this has been evolved as a big problem in the education system. Hence, it is necessary to detect the risk of dropout in advance and apply the required actions to avoid dropout. In our research, we introduce an efficient method that is based on a decision tree that can predict the probability that an existing student dropout from the school and also automatically suggests actions to prevent the school student from dropping out. Moreover, the proposed method tries to convert the student who is having a mediocre degree probability of Non-dropout class as a higher probability of Non-dropout class. Our method also suggests various sets of actions and the number of probable dropout students who can be changed as the Non-dropout students. The proposed machine learning based method uses the probability estimation decision tree to predict the student’s dropout nature. It adopts efficient data structures and employs a novel approach for suggesting the actions. Empirical tests are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method and demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The performance of the students is an important marker that indicates the efficiency of the program and represents the level of success of the reform according to the CDIO methodology. The structure of the curriculum and the gradualness of the integrated competences, reflect a program transition behavior that is aligned with the student development model of the university. Three transitions were identified: first year, second and third year, and advanced students. These transitions show different behaviors and needs that, in the institutional context of risk prevention, involve the identification of realities that require early monitoring and intervention. In order to implement, the student development model, the university generates a risk prevention program that takes into account individual, psychosocial, academic and financial factors. Based on this model, a system of early alerts is created. This system includes intervention and monitoring processes. The initiative is complemented by a student accompaniment program (PAE + N, by its initials in Spanish), which is being developed initially in the School of Engineering. Under this context, it is necessary to design and implement models to identify patterns associated with academic performance and transitions of undergraduate students. This project is developed with the aim of detecting problems which can be intervened by making use of the entire offer of accompaniment from the university (advisors, workshops, psychological counseling, etc.). These patterns are detected using variables available in the University's information ecosystem, using analytical techniques and artificial intelligence. In this paper, the identification methodology for risk patterns is shown. Additionally, some of the alerts that are in development are described including the analysis of their incidence as efficiency indicators of the CDIO program. The results of this project will allow reforms to the courses, the program, the teaching methodologies, learning and assessment, as well as the programs of the accompaniment of students in all transitions. © Proceedings of the International CDIO Conference 2019.","Artificial Intelligence; Drop out; retention; Standards 11, 12; supporting students",,"Al-Atabi M., Grand Challenges for Engineering and Development of CDIO Skills, Proceedings of the 9th International CDIO Conference, (2013); Brodeur B., Crawley E.

Students are facing various difficulties in courses like 'Programming' and 'Data Structures' through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students' data gathered from various educational settings to predict students' academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students' academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students' academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students' performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. © 2013 IEEE.",Deep neural networks; educational data mining; imbalanced dataset problem; machine learning; predicting students' performance; resampling methods,Classification (of information); Data mining; Data structures; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Education computing; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Academic performance; Deep learning; Educational data mining; Imbalanced dataset problems; Performance; Predicting student&#x2019;; Predictive models; Resampling method; Risk of failure; Support vector machine classification; Students,"Ramaphosa K.I.M., Zuva T., Kwuimi R., Educational data mining to improve learner performance in Gauteng primary schools, Proc.

This database contains a vast amount of useful information that is useful for analysis. Algorithms for machine learning play a significant role in mining academic databases and have been proven to be effective when applied in the academic field. Prediction models are made using relevant classification algorithms for dropout analysis. The success of the prediction model depends on the performance of the feature selection algorithm used for dimensionality reduction. The study utilized the Modified Mutated Firefly Algorithm (MMFA) as a dimensionality reduction strategy to enhance the accuracy of the prediction model for dropout analysis. The results of the simulation revealed that the Decision Tree (DT) classifier outperformed the Naïve Bayesian using the three UCI datasets. After the test of benchmark datasets, a students' cumulative dataset was used to come up with a predictive model for dropout analysis of Davao del Norte State College, Davao del Norte, Philippines. The results of the experiment confirmed that the MMFA+DT obtained an accuracy rate of 95.82%, while MMFA+NB only has 92.85% using 10-fold cross-validation. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Thus, finding meaningful patterns in historical data can help education researchers to reveal the possible reasons for students' withdrawal from a university, and can provide guidelines and mechanisms that lead to improving retention rates. To achieve this goal, we considered the importance of different factors in the graduation of computing students, and generated a predictive model for student graduation using the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) dataset. We observed that considering input and environment educational variables, cumulative GPA, number of terms registered, start year, institution, and being a transfer student, are the most important features, respectively. Our results also demonstrate that Random Forest algorithm produced a more accurate result on this dataset compared to other machine learning algorithms. We anticipate findings from this ongoing work will give insight to the computing education community and researchers to better understand the relative success of computing students, and that this will, in turn, enable strategic solutions to attain higher retention rates. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Decision trees; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Computing education; Important features; Machine learning techniques; Predictive modeling; Random forest algorithm; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Strategic solutions; Undergraduate program; Students","'Bureau of labor statistics, u.s. department of labor, occupational outlook handbook, (2019); Chen X., Stem attrition: College students' paths into and out of stem fields, (2013); Zahedi L., Ebrahiminejad H., Ross M.

At the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, we aim to extract insight from big data stored in the educational administration system in the framework of a project carried out in the cooperation of Central Academic Office and Institute of Mathematics. Among many other questions, we studied curriculum prerequisite networks with a student flow approach, the effect of mathematical remediation, the impact of living on-campus on academic achievement, the connection between grade inflation and student evaluation of teaching and efficient visualization of student flows. However, one of the most burning problems in higher STEM education all over the world is dropping out. In this paper, we present a predictive analytical approach for early detection of students at-risk of academic failure. We achieved relatively high accuracy, compared to the results of related works, which makes it suitable to deploy as a decision support system. We also present a web application that is able to identify at-risk students mainly based on their high school grades and matura scores using machine learning algorithms (e.g. XGBoost). The application can also be used to recommend tutoring sessions and remedial courses for at-risk students. Based on SHAP values, the application is also capable of making suggestions for students which skills to improve in order to succeed in their university studies. Besides Hungarian education system, our proposed methodology is also applicable to other educational environments all over the world. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

According to a UNESCO report, India is fifty years behind in achieving the goal of universal secondary education. There is almost a 30% drop in gross enrolment ratio (GER) from secondary education to higher education. In this paper, we use machine learning models to identify the students who are likely to drop out in the ongoing session. We demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first results on a secondary-level education in a developing nation like India to classify students as potential dropouts. We collect data from secondary-level institutions for the academic session 2016–17, which captures the variation in ethnic, social and financial background of students as well as their academic performances. We do feature analysis to find out the most dominant attributes in the dataset and use them in different machine learning algorithms on the task of binary classification for potential dropout. Our best algorithm is able to classify correctly with least number of false negatives. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Binary classification; Developing nation; Dropouts; Feature analysis; Machine learning; Secondary education,Classification (of information); Drops; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Signal processing; Soft computing; Academic performance; Binary classification; Developing nations; Dropouts; Employment opportunities; Feature analysis; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Students,"Basumatary R., School dropout across indian states and uts: Aneconometric study, Int.

Many universities have established First Year Programs to coordinate the activities and classes for first year students. However, not all universities have the funds to establish programs separate from disciplinary programs. How can faculty that are not assigned to a First Year Program efficiently manage multiple sections of a hands-on course with limited resources? There are several models for teaching basic engineering concepts in electrical, mechanical, chemical, computer, civil and system engineering to freshman engineering students. One approach is faculty team-based with each faculty member teaching their specialty at some point during the course. Another approach involves the teaching of basic engineering concepts in only discipline-specific courses by faculty members whose specialties encompass that course's concepts. Both of these traditional approaches described do not require the amount of coordination and overall support from a program coordinator because the faculty members are delivering concepts within their realm of expertise. However, in our model, where one faculty member from one of the engineering programs is teaching basic concepts from all disciplines, a coordinator is needed to ensure that the basic concepts are covered in a consistent and high-quality way. EAS107P Introduction to Engineering - Project-Based is taken by all incoming engineering freshmen first semester at the University of New Haven as part of the Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Foundation Spiral curriculum. Throughout the course, students are introduced to basic engineering concepts through a series of hands-on projects. Student understanding is enhanced as these topics are revisited in subsequent courses taken during the second semester freshman year and through the sophomore year. This approach requires significant collaboration between faculty involved in the spiral curriculum courses in order to achieve the program's intended results, namely, academic consistency across sections, and the need to adequately prepare students for the next tier of courses. This paper discusses our experience at the University of New Haven in addressing issues that arise when running multiple sections of a first semester freshman engineering course. Some of the management issues that occur involve scheduling time of teaching assistants, planning and purchasing materials, scheduling classrooms, recruiting and training full time faculty and adjunct faculty and planning for their schedules, and managing the dissemination of information under tight budget constraints. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.",,Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Scheduling; Students; Coordination and management; Freshman engineering course; Freshman engineering design; Freshman engineering students; Introduction to engineering; Multi disciplinary engineerings; Traditional approaches; Undergraduate engineering programs; Teaching,"Brannan K.P., Wankat P.C., Survey of First-Year Programs, Proceedings, 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, (2005); Fentiman A.W., Demel J.T., Freuler R.J., Gustafson R.J., Merrill J.A., Developing and Implementing an Innovative First Year Program for 1000 Students, Proceedings, 2001 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, (2001); Anderson M., Parker P., Creation of a Project-Based Introduction to Engineering Course, Proceedings, 2003 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, (2003); Collura M.A., Ariane B., Daniels S., Nocito-Gobel J., Development of a Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Foundation Spiral, Proceedings, 2004 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, (2004); Nocito-Gobel J., Daniels S., Collura M., Aliane B., Project-Based Introduction to Engineering - a University Core Course, Proceedings, 2004 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, (2004)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029042079,,

Based on a significant body of previous research, this work expands on previous attempts to predict student outcomes using machinelearning techniques. Using a large data set provided by Columbus State University's Information Technology department, ANNs were used to analyze incoming first-year traditional freshmen students' data over a period from 2005-2011. Using several different network designs, the students' data was analyzed, and a basic predictive network was devised. While the overall accuracy was high when including the first and second semesters worth of data, once the data set was reduced to a single semester, the overall accuracy dropped significantly. Using different network designs, more complex learning algorithms, and better training strategies, the prediction accuracy rate for a student's return to the second year approached 75% overall. Since the rate is still low, there is room for improvements, and several techniques that might increase the reliability of these networks are discussed.

Therefore, this study focuses on the creation of robust predictive models that allow timely anticipation of the risk that an engineering student will retire prematurely from the program. This phenomenon is analyzed in an empirical way through a methodology of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) using different machine learning techniques. Results show that the academic cost (in terms of the number of subjects viewed) and the semester the student entered have a significant impact on the probability of dropout occurring, especially when considering the dropout in the firsts semester.

While this has been well-publicized in the media in the United States, Canada's numbers in this regard have been significantly worse. Within Canada, however, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manitoba has been relatively fortunate: while a noticeable decrease has occurred, it is statistically much less than has occurred across Canada and the U.S. There are a number of reasons for this, one of which is the use of artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics in particular, as a tool for student recruitment and retention. In this paper, we examine enrollment trends of our university compared to the rest of the continent, discuss some of the reasons behind these trends, and describe how we use AI, and robotics in particular, as tools to attract and retain computer science students.

Many studies document positive effects of interventions that involve active learning approaches. In this paper we summarize the factors affecting retention and satisfaction in engineering, provide an overview of active learning methodologies, and describe an intervention that combines three of such methodologies (project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, and collaborative learning) in a first-year introduction to engineering course at Rutgers - School of Engineering, a mid-sized engineering institution. The course had positive effects on retention and satisfaction of engineering students. Specifically we found that three-year retention increased by 19%; and students reported higher satisfaction with their experiences compared to the students enrolled in a traditionally taught introduction to engineering course. These findings support previous studies that an engaging first year experience can have dramatic effects on the future engineers and offer some practical recommendations for the institutions that consider similar reforms. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.",,Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Students; Technical presentations; Collaborative learning; Engineering institutions; First-year engineering designs; Inquiry-based learning; Introduction to engineering course; Practical recommendation; Project based learning; School of engineering; Engineering education,"Ercolano V., From Sleep 101 to Success 101, pp. 24-29, (1995); Ercolano V., Designing Freshman, pp. 20-25, (1996); Hake R., Interactive-engagement versus traditional methods: A six- Thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses, American Journal of Physics, 66, 1, (1998); Tezcan J., Nicklow J., Mathias J., Gupta L., Kowalchuk R., An InnovativeFreshmen Engineering Course to Improve Retention, (2008); Sheppard S., Jenison R., Examples of freshman design education, International Journal of Engineering Education, 13, 4, pp. 248-261, (1997); Carlson L.E., Sullivan J.F., Hands-on engineering: Learning by doing in the integrated teaching and learning program, International Journal of Engineering Education, 15, 1, pp. 20-31, (1999); Barab S., Squire K., Design-based research: Putting a stake in the ground, The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13, 1, pp. 1-14, (2004); Bell P., On the theoretical breadth of design-based research in education, Educational Psychologist, 39, 4, pp. 243-253, (2004); Prendergast L., Retention, Success, and Satisfaction of Engineering Students Based on the First-Year Experience, (2013); Prendergast L., Albertalli Engineering Exploration, (2009); National Academy of Engineering, (2005); Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, (2010); Kittleson J., Southerland S., The role of discourse in group knowledge construction: A case study of engineering students, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 3, pp. 267-293, (2004); Shaping the Future: New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology, (1999); Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, (2011); Hall D., Cronk S., Brackin P., Barker M., Crittenden K., Living with the Lab: A Curriculum to Prepare Freshman Students to Meet the Attributes of The Engineer of 2020, (2008); Ideas to Innovation (I2i) Learning Laboratory; Lengsfeld C., Edelstein G., Black J., Hightower N., Root M., Stevens K., Whitt M., Engineering concepts and communication: A two-quarter course sequence, Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 79-85, (2004); Yalvac B., Smith H., Troy J., Hirsch, Promoting advanced writing skills in an upper-level engineering class, Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 117-128, (2007); Retention of the Best Science and Engineering Graduates in Science and Engineering; Going the Distance, (2012); Borrego M., Froyd J.E., Hall T.S., Diffusion of engineering education innovations: A survey of awareness and adoption rates in U.

The extraction of hidden information from these databases often implements aspects of the educational data mining (EDM) theory, which aims to study available data in order to shed light on more valuable, hidden information. Data clustering, classification, and regression methods such as K-means clustering, neural networks (NN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and support vector machines (SVM) can be used for to predict aspects of the educational data. EDM outputs can ultimately identify which students will need additional help to improve their grade point averages (GPAs) at graduation. Purpose of Study: This study aims to implement several prediction techniques in data mining to assist educational institutions with predicting their students' GPAs at graduation. If students are predicted to have low GPAs at graduation, then extra efforts can be made to improve their academic performance and, in turn, GPAs. Methods: NN, SVM, and ELM algorithms are applied to data of computer education and instructional technology students to predict their GPAs at graduation. Findings and Results: A comparative analysis of the results indicates that the SVM technique yielded more accurate predictions at a rate of 97.98%. By contrast, the ELM method yielded the second most accurate prediction rate (94.92%) evaluated based on the criterion of correlation coefficient. NN reported the least accurate prediction rate (93.76%). Conclusions and Recommendations: The use of data mining methodologies has recently expanded for a variety of educational purposes. The assessment of students' needs, dropout liability, performance, and placement test improvement are some important emerging data mining applications in education. Since educational institutions have several seemingly unsolvable domain-related problems, this study's results reveal that EDM can assist with how educational institutions analyze and solve these problems. Furthermore, ensemble models can be used to obtain improved results, while feature selection algorithms can be used to reduce the computational complexity of the prediction methods. © 2014 ANI Publishing.",Educational data mining; GPA prediction; Higher education; Prediction methods,,"AI-Radaideh Q.A., AI-Shawakfa E.W., AI-Najjar M.I., Mining student data using decision trees.

Several factors have been found and determined potentially capable to stimulate dropouts. Many researchers have been applied data mining methods to analyze, predict dropout students and also optimize finding dropout variables in advance. The main objective of this study is to find the best modeling solution in identifying dropout student predictors from 17432 student data of a private university in Jakarta. We also analyze and measure the correlation between demographic indicators and academic performance to predict student dropout using three single classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). We found indicators such as student’s attendance, homework-grade, mid-test grade, and finals-test grade, total credit, GPA, student's area, parent's income, parent’s education level, gender and age as student’s dropout predictors. The results only get 64.29 (NB), 64.84% (DT), and 75.27%(KNN) while we tried to combine algorithms with Ensemble Classifier Methods using Gradient Boosting as meta-classifier and gets better about 79.12%. In addition, we also get the best accuracy of about 98.82% using this method which was tested by 10-fold cross-validation. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

To begin with, we focus on the characteristics of start and dropout point of learners through the statistics of their start time and dropout time. Then we construct two models. First, several approaches of machine learning are used to build a sliding window model for predicting the dropout probabilities in a certain course. Second, SVM is used to build the model for predicting whether a student can get a score at the end of the course. For instructors and designers of MOOCs, dynamically tracking the records of the dropouts could be helpful to improve the course quality in order to reduce the dropout rate. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Dropout prediction; Dropout rate; MOOCs; Sliding window model,Data mining; Database systems; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Quality management; Semantics; Course qualities; Log structures; MOOCs; Peking University; Sliding window models; Big data,"Amnueypornsakul B., Bhat S., Chinprutthiwong P., Predicting attrition along the way: The UIUC model, Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Analysis of Large Scale Social Interaction in Moocs, pp. 55-59, (2014); Bienkowski M., Feng M., Means B., Enhancing Teaching and Learning through Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics: An Issue Brief, pp. 1-57, (2012); Elouazizi N., Point-of-view mining and cognitive presence in MOOCs: A (computational) linguistics perspective, EMNLP 2014, (2014); Guo P.J., Reinecke K., Demographic differences in how students navigate through MOOCs, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale Conference, pp. 21-30, (2014); Jordan K., MOOC Completion Rates: The Data, (2013); Kloft M., Stiehler F., Zheng Z., Pinkwart N., Predicting MOOC dropout over weeks using machine learning methods, Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Analysis of Large Scale Social Interaction in Moocs, pp. 60-65, (2014); Mi F., Machine Learning Models for Some Learning Analytics Issues in Massive Open Online Courses, (2015); Mining T.E.D., Enhancing teaching and learning through educational data mining and learning analytics: An issue brief, Proceedings of Conference on Advanced Technology for Education, (2012); Moon S., Potdar S., Martin L., Identifying student leaders from MOOC discussion forums through language influence, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 15-20, (2014); Rose C.P., Siemens G., Shared task on prediction of dropout over time in massively open online courses, Proceedings of EMNLP, 14, (2014); Sharkey M., Sanders R., A process for predicting MOOC attrition, Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Analysis of Large Scale Social Interaction in Moocs, pp. 50-54, (2014); Sinha T., Jermann P., Li N., Dillenbourg P., Your Click Decides Your Fate: Inferring Information Processing and Attrition Behavior from MOOC Video Clickstream Interactions; Taylor C., Veeramachaneni K., O'Reilly U.M., Likely to stop?, Predicting Stopout in Massive Open Online Courses; Yang D., Sinha T., Adamson D., Rose C.P., Turn on, tune in, drop out: Anticipating student dropouts in massive open online courses, Proceedings of the 2013 NIPS Data-Driven Education Workshop, 11, (2013); Yang D., Wen M., Rose C., Towards identifying the resolvability of threads in MOOCs, EMNLP 2014, (2014)","S.

Mining historical data on manufactured goods and services is becoming the customary approach for decision-making these days. This work proposes to extend these now standard operating procedures in industry to the educational arena. The Department of Industrial Engineering at University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez (IE@UPRM) is currently planning a curricular reform. Unidentified student records from students enrolled in the IE program within the last ten years were used to create a profile of successful IE students. The approach was to retrospectively examine students before starting at UPRM, throughout their undergraduate careers, and via exit metrics; in order to determine curricular reform efforts that will increase retention and improve a student's likelihood to obtain a degree from IE@UPRM on time. Traditional multivariate statistics and machine learning algorithms were used to extract the structural patterns of successful alumni from IE@UPRM. These patterns allowed to identify core courses that require an intervention during a curricular reform and those elective courses that should be evaluated as core courses in the near future. Last but not least, these retrospective analyses allowed pin-point specific populations on which to focus future retention efforts.",Association rules; Curricular reform; Decision trees,,"Eskandari H., Sala-Diakanda S., Furterer S., Rabelo L., Crumpton-Young L., Williams K., Enhancing the undergraduate industrial engineering curriculum, Educ.

In addition, non-contiguous retention data obtained with different LC-MS instruments or in different laboratories must be aligned to confirm and utilize rapidly accumulating published proteomics data. Results: We have developed a new alignment method for peptide retention times based on linear solvent strength (LSS) theory. We found that log k0 (logarithm of retention factor for a given organic solvent) in the LSS theory can be utilized as a 'universal' retention index of peptides (RIP) that is independent of LC gradients, and depends solely on the constituents of the mobile phase and the stationary phases. We introduced a machine learning-based scheme to optimize the conversion function of gradient retention times (tg) to log k0. Using the optimized function, tg values obtained with different LC-MS systems can be directly compared with each other on the RIP scale. In an examination of Arabidopsis proteomic data, the vast majority of retention time variability was removed, and five datasets obtained with various LC-MS systems were successfully aligned on the RIP scale. © The Author 2008.

With the goal of improving student learning and retention, the School of Engineering (SoE) has undertaken a program in which Undergraduate Teaching Fellows (UGTFs) are utilized in key courses across the School. The UGTFs support in-class activities, such as team-based problem-solving, hands-on activities and demonstrations. This program has grown from four UGTFs in Spring 2015 to 28 UGTFs in Spring 2017, with UGTFs embedded in 13 courses across the SoE. This paper explores the impact of the UGTF program by investigating three primary questions. First, has the program resulted in greater adoption of active learning techniques? We hypothesized that the program would allow faculty to engage with active learning techniques at a higher level or spark a change in course structure. This question was investigated by analyzing faculty surveys, UGTF surveys, and class observations. Next, are students and faculty more satisfied with the course outcomes given the UGTF resources? This was investigated by analyzing student surveys and course evaluations. We hypothesized that students and faculty would have greater satisfaction with the courses. Finally, has the program positively impacted student learning? This question was investigated by tracking changes in learning outcomes over time for each of the 11 courses with UGTF support in 2015. Outcomes for four key courses were focused upon: CE 301 (Civil Engineering Statics and Dynamics), CE 310 (Civil Engineering Strengths of Materials), ME 320 (Mechanical Engineering Dynamics), and ME 211 (Mechanical Engineering Statics). Learning outcomes were assessed by comparing student performance in downstream courses based on whether students took the prerequisite course with or without UGTFs. Results of this investigation showed that students and faculty groups both responded very positively to the UGTF program, perceiving that the program resulted in improved student outcomes. Class observations performed using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) showed that in courses utilizing UGTFs, the majority of class-time was spent on activities other than listening, indicating that the UGTF program was successful in supporting student-centered teaching practices. The data that was examined for downstream course performance was suggestive of positive learning gains, but not conclusive at this stage as many students who were in courses with UGTFs have not yet taken the following courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Education; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Problem solving; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Surveys; Engineering statics; Hands-on activities; Observation protocol; School of engineering; Student performance; Student-centered teaching; Undergraduate engineering course; Undergraduate teaching; Teaching","Amaral K.E., Vala M., What teaching teaches: Mentoring and the performance gains of mentors, J.

The course creates, deploys and tests in the field a new educational approach to inspire future inventors. In addition to teaching STEM skills in a hands-on and collaborative manner, the course presents high school students with role models in the form of undergraduate mentors, instructors, researchers, and guest speakers in class and during field trips. The course thus helps empower them, helps them gain confidence in the classroom, but also experience a foretaste of being a college student. By the end of the pilot course in Summer 2016, we asked students if they felt they could be engineers or inventors in the future. A strong majority (91%) agreed they could. Several aspects of the bootcamp are unique, and we would like to share the key learnings. They include: 1) The application process, which was based on non-cognitive variables. No grades were required. Applicants needed to deliver a 2-min video showing their motivation and how they would improve their school cafeteria. Students needed to have a curiosity towards STEM fields and the invention process. A recommendation letter was also needed. 2) The population targeted, which is underrepresented students in STEM such as minorities, women, and low income students. 3) The hiring and training of eight undergraduate mentors and a mentor coordinator. We had one mentor per group of three high school students. The mentor program created a supportive environment to provide students with the emotional, academic and technical support they needed to be successful in this course. By offering close, near-peer support, we enhanced student learning, classroom effectiveness, and retention of students. The majority of mentors was in the classroom with students for the entire program. They all are engineering students with a strong engineering background, and a good attitude under stress and in groups. 5) The hands-on curriculum, that meshed engineering tools (soldering iron, milling machine, hand tools, laser cutter, 3D printer), visit of guest lecturers (local entrepreneurs and innovators), and work on group projects using a human-center design thinking approach. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"3D printers; Education; Engineering education; Hand tools; Patents and inventions; Personnel training; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Teaching; Application process; Classroom effectiveness; Cognitive variables; Educational approach; High school students; Interdisciplinary programs; Underrepresented students; University settings; Students","Dejarnette N.K., America's children: Providing early exposure to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) initiatives, Reading Improvement, 53, 4, pp. 181-187, (2016); S.

One of the most common applications of data mining is the use of different algorithms and tools to estimate future events based on previous experiences. In this context, many researchers have been using data mining techniques to support and solve challenges in higher education. There are many challenges facing this level of education, one of which is helping students to choose the right course to improve their success rate. An early prediction of students’ grades may help to solve this problem and improve students’ performance, selection of courses, success rate and retention. In this paper we use different classification techniques in order to build a performance prediction model, which is based on previous students’ academic records. The model can be easily integrated into a recommender system that can help students in their course selection, based on their and other graduated students’ grades. Our model uses two of the most recognised decision tree classification algorithms: ID3 and J48. The advantages of such a system have been presented along with a comparison in performance between the two algorithms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Education; Education computing; Forecasting; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Students; Academic performance; Classification technique; Decision tree classification; Early prediction; Higher education; Level of educations; Model use; Performance prediction models; Data mining,"Wook M., Yahaya Y.H., Wahab N., Isa M.R.M., Awang N.F., Hoo Yann S., Predicting NDUM student’s academic performance using data mining techniques, Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering, ICCEE, pp. 357-361, (2009); Hoe A.K., Ahmad M.S., Tan Chin H., Shanmugam M., Gunasekaran S.S., Cob Z.C., Ramasamy A., Analyzing students records to identify patterns of students’ performance, International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS), pp. 544-547, (2013); Heiner C., Baker R., Yacef K., Preface, Workshop on Educational Data Mining at the 8Th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), (2006); Dunham M.H., Data Mining: Introductory and Advanced Topics, (2006); Taruna S., Pandey M., An empirical analysis of classification techniques for predicting academic performance, IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC), pp. 523-528, (2014); Bunkar K., Singh U.K., Pandya B., Bunkar R., Data mining: Prediction for performance improvement of graduate students using classification, Ninth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN), pp. 1-5, (2012); Vialardi C., Bravo J., Shafti L., Ortigosa A., Recommendation in higher education using data mining techniques, International Working Group on Educational Data Mining, (2009); Garcia E.P.I., Mora P.M., Model prediction of academic performance for first year students, 10Th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI), pp. 169-174, (2011); Bhardwaj B.K., Pal S., Data mining: A prediction for performance improvement using classification, Int.

Even the most developed European countries face 40% to 50% dropout rate of engineering students during their first year, and the rate can be as high as 80% for some engineering disciplines. This problem calls attention of educators and university administration to take measures which can help in the reduction of the dropout rate and assist students in successfully completing their degree. Among many other solutions to control the student dropout rate, one is the adoption of a prediction mechanism whereby students can be warned about their potentially poor performance so that they can improve their performance resulting in better grades. Most of the existing prediction mechanisms apply various machine learning techniques on student cognitive features. In addition, non-cognitive features also have significant impact on students' performance; however, they have been sparsely applied for prediction. This research aims at improving the existing prediction mechanism by exploiting both cognitive and non-cognitive features of students for predicting their results. It has been found in the result analysis that addition of cognitive features increases prediction accuracies of decision tree; however, the addition does not play a significant role in other techniques. The study also identified the individual cognitive features that should be considered by students and universities to cater for drop outs. © 2017 The Author(s).",decision tree; Educational data mining; logistic regression; Naïve Bayes; neural networks; non-cognitive data; student performance prediction,Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Neural networks; Trees (mathematics); Educational data mining; Electrical engineering students; Engineering disciplines; Machine learning techniques; non-cognitive data; Prediction accuracy; Prediction mechanisms; Student performance; Students,"Dropout and Completion in Higher Education in Europe Annex 3: Country Case Studies Europe Policy Briefings Australia, (2015); Sittichai R., Why are there dropouts among university students?

This paper examines whether students' non-cognitive factors can be used, alone or in combination with cognitive factors, in artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict engineering student's future retention. Four ANN based retention prediction models using different combinations of non-cognitive and cognitive factors are presented. The independent variables includes survey items from nine non-cognitive constructs (leadership, deep learning, surface learning, teamwork, self-efficacy, motivation, meta-cognition, expectancy-value, and major decision) and eleven cognitive items representing student's high school academic performance. The dependent variable (i.e., the output from these models) is the student's retention status after one year. Data from more than 4900 first-year engineering students from three freshman cohorts (2004, 2005, 2006) in a large Midwestern university were collected and utilized in training and testing these ANN prediction models. Among the four ANN models developed, the model combining 11 cognitive items and 60 selected non-cognitive items has the highest overall prediction accuracy at 71.3%, probability of detection (POD) for retained students at 78.7% and POD for not retained student at 40.5%. Removing the 11 cognitive items from this model, the overall prediction accuracy would drop slightly to 70.5%. Results from training and testing the same model using student data from different cohorts indicate the ANN model's predictive performance is generally stable across different cohort years. Also, a model trained with earlier year (2004) freshman cohort's data has maintained its predictive power very well when tested with student data from later (2005 and 2006) cohorts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2008.",,Deep neural networks; Education; Engineering education; Forecasting; Neural networks; Professional aspects; Artificial intelligence methods; Artificial neural network models; First-year engineering; Independent variables; Predictive performance; Probability of detection; Retention prediction; Training and testing; Students,"Friedman T.L., The World Is Flat- A Brief History of The Twenty-First Century, (2005); National Academies Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century, Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future, (2005); Beaufait F.W., Engineering Education Needs Surgery, Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference, 1991, pp. 519-522, (1991); Astin A.W., Engineering Outcomes, ASEE Prism, 1993, pp. 27-30, (1993); Maller S., Immekus J., Imbrie P.K., Wu N., McDermott P., Work In Progress: An Examination of Engineering Students' Profile Membership Over the Freshman Year, Proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference, (2005); Imbrie P.K., Lin J.J., Use of a Neural Network Model and Noncognitive Measures to Predict Student Matriculation in Engineering, Proceeding of the 2007 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition, (2007); Besterfield-Sacre M., Atman C., Shuman L., Characteristics of Freshman Engineering Students: Models for Determining Student Attrition in Engineering, Journal of Engineering Education, 86, pp. 139-149, (1997); Jagacinski C., LeBold W., A Comparison of Men and Women Undergraduate and Professional Engineers, Journal of Engineering Education, 72, pp. 213-220, (1981); Felder R., Forrest K., Baker-Ward L., Dietz E., Mohr P., A Longitudinal Study of Engineering Student Performance and Retention I.

In this paper we describe the results of an educational data analytics case study focused on detection of dropout of Systems Engineering (SE) undergraduate students after 6 years of enrollment in a Colombian university. Original data is extended and enriched using a feature engineering process. Our experimental results showed that simple algorithms achieve reliable levels of accuracy to identify predictors of dropout. Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest results were compared in order to propose the best option. Also, Watson Analytics is evaluated to establish the usability of the service for a non expert user. Main results are presented in order to decrease the dropout rate by identifying potential causes. In addition, we present some findings related to data quality to improve the students data collection process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Educational data mining; Prediction models; Student desertion prediction; Student drop out,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Drops; Forecasting; Data collection process; Drop-out; Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Feature engineerings; Logistic regressions; Prediction model; Undergraduate students; Students,"Al-Radaideh Q.A., Al-Shawakfa E.M., Al-Najjar M.I., (2006); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting Student Dropout in Higher Education; Baradwaj B.K., Pal S., Mining Educational Data to Analyze students’ Performance, (2012); Bhardwaj B.K., Pal S., Data Mining: A Prediction for Performance Improvement Using Classification, (2012); Brunner J.J., Et al., Higher Education in Regional and City Development Antioquia, (2016); Brunsden V., Davies M., Shevlin M., Bracken M., Why do he students dropout?

Students are especially vulnerable in the initial years of their academic programs; more than 60% of the dropouts occur in the first two years. Therefore, early identification of at-risk students is crucial for a focused intervention if institutions are to support students towards completion. In this paper we developed and evaluated a survival analysis framework for the early identification of students at the risk of dropping out. We compared the performance of survival analysis approaches to other machine learning approaches including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting. The proposed methods show good performance for early prediction of at-risk students and are also able to predict when a student will dropout with high accuracy. We performed a comparative analysis of nine different majors with varying levels of academic rigor, challenge and student body. This study enables advisors and university administrators to intervene in advance to improve student retention. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Classification; Regression; Student retention;

Mechatronics is loosely defined as the application of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer intelligence to the design of products or systems. By its nature, mechatronics is an activity-oriented course. The course content also provides an opportunity to employ interdisciplinary collaborative learning with active learning techniques. The mechatronics course at Bucknell consists of mechanical and electrical engineering students at the senior and graduate levels. The students engage in a variety of activities in teams comprised of members from each of these groups. In addition to team laboratory exercises and homework assignments, the students work in interdisciplinary groups to process their efforts. That is, they engage in meaningful discussion among themselves concerning their activities and the implications of the various results. The students also act as teachers by preparing lectures and exercises on topics from their discipline to the students in the cross discipline. Specifically, the electrical engineers teach the mechanical engineers microcontrollers, and the mechanical engineers teach the electrical engineers mechanisms. This paper describes the learning techniques employed in this course, as well as the interpretation of the results from the students. It also discusses the relationship of the course outcomes to Criterion 3 of the engineering accreditation criteria promulgated by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (EAC/ABET).",,Accreditation; Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Electrical engineering; Mechanical engineering; Mechanisms; Mechatronics; Microcontrollers; Students; Teaching; Collaborative skills; Computer intelligence; Interdisciplinary collaborative learning; Learning techniques; Learning systems,"Harashima F., Tomizuka M., Fukuda T., Mechatronics: What is it, why and how, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 1, 1, pp. 1-3, (1996); Kyura N., Oho H., Mechatronics: An industrial perspective, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 1, 1, pp. 10-15, (1996); Auslander D., What is Mechatronics?, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 1, 1, pp. 5-9, (1996); Durfee W.K., Designing smart machines: Teaching mechatronics to mechanical engineers through a project-based, creative design course, Mechatronics, 5, 7, pp. 775-785, (1995); Carryer J.E., The design of laboratory experiments and projects for mechatronics courses, Mechatronics, 5, 7, pp. 787-797, (1995); Rizzoni G., Keyhani A., Design of mechatronic systems: An integrated interdepartmental curriculum, Mechatronics, 5, 7, pp. 845-860, (1995); Dale E.,  Edition, (1997); Smith K.A., Johnson D., Johnson R., Active Learning: Cooperation in the College Classroom, (1991); Smith K.A., Johnson D., Johnson R., Cooperative Learning: Increasing College Faculty Instructional Productivity, (1991); Engineering Criteria 2000","S.

Academic failure is a relevant issue at a time when post-secondary education is ever more critical to economic success. We aim at early detection of potential failure using student data available at registration, i.e. school records and environmental factors, with a view to timely and efficient remediation and/or study reorientation. We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artificial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different fields.

An instructor practicing active learning approaches may get significantly higher success in inculcating course materials deeply as compared to a lecture based teaching. However, transitioning from prevailing lecture based instruction to an active learning approach can be hampered by the reservations and prejudices of an engineering educator; a tenure track faculty may find it even more challenging to leave the traditional lecture based teaching approach and adopt an active teaching approach. This paper will describe the active teaching techniques that I, a tenure track faculty, has been practicing to teach mechanical engineering courses; the main discussion will focus on the Fuel Cell Science and Technology course. I have devised my current deep learning and teaching strategies through a yearlong Myrtilla Miner Faculty Fellowship cohort under Dr. Ken Bain and a number of workshops on the group based active teaching and peer interaction based teaching. This paper describes the strategies for developing a teaching and assessment plan for the courses I teach by emphasizing on (i) designing significant learning outcomes before starting a class, (ii) the long term retention of key concepts of a course by fostering student centered deep learning course activities, and (iii) far transfer of the skills students gain from a course. The first topic of this paper is about various strategies to understand students' motivations and inhibitions that may govern their learning curve in a course. The second topic of this paper discusses the crucial aspect of designing a promising syllabus to give students a bigger purpose for learning the course material; a promising syllabus attempt to connect students' long held curiosities and career ambitions with the course to be offered. The third topic delves into the strategies to engage students in self-preparation to assimilate the key concepts to be discussed in a class. This paper will also highlight the approach to design conceptual quizzes to guide student preparation before they come to the class and then use the same conceptual quizzes to conduct peer discussion and define the flow of a class; this strategy is derived from Dr. Eric Mazur's work on peer interaction based teaching. The fourth topic is about the utility of one pager feedback form to be filled by the students after every class. This paper will discuss structure and effectiveness of the feedback form in improving student attention and participation in the class discussions. I have offered two workshops on effective teaching at the University of the District of Columbia to promote active student learning in a wide range of courses. I plan to conduct workshops for the middle and high school teachers to share the effective teaching skills.

The main goal of this area is to extract hidden patterns from student academic performances and behaviors. One of the main topics in academic analytics is to study the academic performance of freshman students. Students enrolled in first year are the most vulnerable to low student retention in higher education institution. Research studies from different Higher Educational Institutions already indicated that early identification of students with academic difficulty is very crucial in the development of intervention programs. As such, early identification of potential leavers and successful intervention program(s) are the keys for improving student retention. The study will utilize the available enrollment and admission data. Feature selection technique will be used to determine significant attributes. The study aims to produce predictive and cluster model in which can early identify students who are in need of academic help and program interventions. The extracted predictive and cluster models will be evaluated using confusion matrix and be integrated in the decision support application. © Proceedings of 2018 the 8th International Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering, WCSE 2018.

The method includes identifying the main skills of tutors in an automated manner using decision trees, one of the most used algorithms in the machine learning community for solving several real-world problems with high accuracy. In our study, the decision tree algorithm was able to identify those skills and personal affinities between students and tutors. Experiments were carried out using a data set of 277 students and 19 tutors, which were selected by random sampling and voluntary participation, respectively. Preliminary results show that the most important attributes for tutors are communication, self-direction and digital skills. At the same time, we introduce a tutoring process where the tutor assignment is based on these attributes, assuming that it can help to strengthen the student's skills demanded by today's society. In the same way, the decision tree obtained can be used to create cluster of tutors and clusters of students based on their personal abilities and affinities using other machine learning algorithms. The application of the suggested tutoring process could set the tone to see the tutoring process individually without linking it to processes of academic performance or school dropout. © 2018 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

Ideally, early indicators of student progress, or lack thereof, can be used to provide appropriate interventions that increase the likelihood of student success. In this paper we present a framework that uses machine learning, and in particular, a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), to predict the performance of students early in their academic careers. The results obtained show that the proposed framework can predict student progress, specifically student grade point average (GPA) within the intended major, with minimal error after observing a single semester of performance. Furthermore, as additional performance is observed, the predicted GPA in subsequent semesters becomes increasingly accurate, providing the ability to advise students regarding likely success outcomes early in their academic careers. © 2014 IEEE.",,Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Data mining; Forecasting; Academic careers; Colleges and universities; Early indicators; Graduation rates; Minimal errors; Student grades; Student progress; Student success; Students,"Performance funding for higher education, National Conference of State Legislatures, (2012); Venezia A., Callan P.M., Finney J.E., Kirst M.W., Usdan M.D., The Governance Divide: A Report on A Four-state Study on Improving College Readiness and Success, (2005); Zhang L., Does state funding affect graduation rates at public four-year colleges and universities?, Educational Policy, 23, 5, pp. 714-731, (2009); Educational Attainment in the United States, (2012); Wigdahl J., Heileman G.L., Slim A., Abdallah C.T., Curricular efficiency: What role does it play in student success?, Proceedings of the the 121st ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, (2014); Slim A., Kozlick J., Heileman G.L., Wigdahl J., Abdallah C.T., Network analysis of university courses, Proceedings of the 6th Annual Workshop on Simplifying Complex Networks for Practitioners, (2014); Slim A., Kozlick J., Heileman G.L., Wigdahl J., Abdallah C.T., The complexity of university curricula according to course cruciality, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, (2014); Heckerman D., A tutorial on learning with bayesian networks, Learning in Graphical Models, Tech.

This distinction is applied here to studies of the problem of student attrition (although it is more widely applicable). Background: Studies of attrition from nursing courses have tended to concentrate on causation, trying, largely unsuccessfully, to elicit what causes drop out. However, the problem may more fruitfully be cast in terms of predicting who is likely to drop out. Methods: One powerful method for attempting to make predictions is rule induction. This paper reports the use of the Answer Tree package from SPSS for that purpose. Data: The main data set consisted of 3978 records on 528 nursing students, split into a training set and a test set. The source was standard university student records. Results: The method obtained 84% sensitivity, 70% specificity, and 94% accuracy on previously unseen cases. Discussion: The method requires large amounts of high quality data. When such data are available, rule induction offers a way to reduce attrition. It would be desirable to compare its results with those of predictions made by tutors using more informal conventional methods. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Active learning has a significant positive impact on learning, understanding, and retention of information. Fortunately, active learning can be incorporated into a course in many ways, from simple approaches that require little-to-no preparation to more complex approaches such as problem based learning. Simple approaches offer the advantages of being readily accessible to newer or time-constrained instructors, not requiring a radical change or overhaul of a course, and providing stepping stones to more complex approaches. In this study, we explored the repeated use of simple active learning techniques (i.e., think-pair-share and the minute paper) in an introductory electrical and computer engineering course in digital logic in the fall 2016. This course had previously been taught in a traditional lecture fashion. With the think-pair-share activities, students were asked to individually (and then in pairs) answer a question or solve a problem involving (for example) the illustration of a circuit and/or its mathematical expression. With the minute paper, students were asked at the end of class to write down their muddiest points, main takeaways, and/or questions based upon their lecture notes. To directly assess the effectiveness of this new approach, current rubric-derived exam results were compared with previous exam results, taking GPA into account. We obtained significantly-higher final exam scores during the active semester. Semi-structured student interviews were also conducted before class sessions and content-analyzed by two analysts to indirectly assess the impact of the techniques on student learning. Based on the interview data, the very large majority of students found the techniques to be helpful to their learning, with most citing the ability to talk to and work with their classmates to solve problems. In addition, the classroom was observed using the COPUS observation protocol to describe it and determine the level of activity and interaction. The instructor's main takeaway from his first use of these techniques is that they lead to large gains with little-to-no extra time or preparation. Although he had previously not used them due to a perceived lack of time, his advice to new faculty is to try these techniques in their courses. Additional instructor insights and reflections will also be discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Problem solving; Students; Teaching; Electrical and computer engineering; Mathematical expressions; Observation protocol; Problem based learning; Simple approach; Student interviews; Student learning; Student-centered active learning; Education,"Allen D., Tanner K., Infusing active learning into the large-enrollment biology class: Seven strategies, from the simple to complex, Cell Biology Education, 4, 4, pp. 262-268, (2005); Almer E., Jones K., Moeckel C., The impact of one-minute papers on learning in an introductory accounting course, Issues in Accounting Education, 13, 3, pp. 485-497, (1998); Angelo T., Cross K.P., Classroom Assessment Techniques, (1993); Bart M., Reader Survey Finds Unprepared Students a Persistent Problem, (2016); Bataineh M., Think-pair-share, co op-co op and traditional learning strategies on undergraduate academic performance, Journal of Educational and Social Research, 5, 1, pp. 217-226, (2015); Bonwell C., Eison J., Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom, (1991); Boulmetis J., Dutwin P., The ABCs of Evaluation: Timeless Techniques for Program and Project Managers, (2011); Brown S., Vranesic Z., Fundamentals of Digital Logic with Verilog Design, (2009); Chi M., Active-constructive-interactive: A conceptual framework for differentiating learning activities, Topics in Cognitive Science, 1, 1, pp. 73-105, (2009); Chiou C.C., Wang Y.M., Lee L.T., Reducing statistics anxiety and enhancing statistics learning achievement: Effectiveness of a one-minute strategy, Psychological Reports, 115, 1, pp. 297-310, (2014); Chizmar J., Ostrosky A., The one-minute paper: Some empirical findings, The Journal of Economic Education, 29, 1, pp. 3-10, (1998); Cohen J., Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, pp. 24-27, (1987); Deshpande A., Salman B., Think-pair-share: Application of an active learning technique in engineering and construction management classes, Proceedings of the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC) Annual International Conference, Provo, UT, (2016); Dol S., Tps (think-pair-share): An active learning strategy to teach theory of computation course, International Journal of Educational Research and Technology, 5, 4, pp. 62-67, (2014); Felder R., A longitudinal study of engineering student performance and retention.

Three sets of linguistic features are generated from text analysis: (1) latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based topic modeling with a variety of topic numbers, (2) Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), and (3) part-of-speech (POS) distribution. Various classification experiments are implemented to evaluate the prediction performance of student retention patterns from these three feature sets and their combinations. The results show that the POS distribution features yield the best prediction performance among these three, while neither the LDA features nor ensemble methods improves predictive performance, which is contrary to admission experts' manual analysis methods in the conventional admission processes. © 2017 IEEE.",application essay; educational data mining; linguistic features; predictive analysis; student retention,Application programs; Classification (of information); Data mining; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Statistics; Students; Academic program; Distribution features; Educational data mining; Latent dirichlet allocations; Linguistic features; Prediction performance; Predictive performance; Student retention; Linguistics,"Haythornthwaite C., De Laat M., Dawson S., Introduction to the special issue on learning analytics., American Behavioral Science, 57, 10, pp. 1371-1379, (2013); Romero C., Ventura S., Educational Data Mining: A Review of the State of the Art, 40, 6, pp. 601-618, (2010); Siemens G., Learning analytics: The emergence of a discipline., American Behavioral Scientist, 57, 10, pp. 1380-1400, (2013); Kabakchieva D., Predicting student performance by using data mining methods for classification., Cybernetics and Information Technologies, 13, 1, pp. 61-72, (2013); He J., Bailey J., Rubinstein B.I.P., Zhang R., Identifying at-risk students in massive open online courses, Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1749-1755, (2015); Jiang S., Williams A., Schenke K., Warschauer M., O'Dowd D., Predicting MOOC performance with week 1 behavior, Educational Data Mining, (2014); Yang D., Sinha T., Adamson D., Rose C.P., Turn on, tune in, drop out: Anticipating student dropouts in massive open online courses, Proceedings of the 2013 NIPS Data-driven Education Workshop, 11, (2013); Chang L., Applying data mining to predict college admissions yield: A case study, New Directions for Institutional Research, pp. 53-68, (2006); Dekker G., Pechenizkiy M., Vleeshouwers J., Predicting students drop out: A case study, Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference On Educational Data Mining, (2009); De Freitas S., Gibson D., Du Plessis C., Halloran P., Williams E., Ambrose M., Dunwell I., Arnab S., Foundations of dynamic learning analytcs: Using university student data to increase retention, Britsih Journal of Educational Technology, 46, 6, pp. 1175-1188, (2015); Ifenthaler D., Widanapathirana C., Development and validation of a learning analytics framework: Two case studies using Support Vector Machines, Technology, Knowledge, and Learning, 19, pp. 221-240, (2014); Wen M., Yang D., Rose C.P., Sentiment analysis in MOOC discussion forums: What does it tell us?, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference On Educational Data Mining, pp. 130-137, (2014); Robinson R.L., Navea R., Ickes W., Predicting final course performance from students' written self-introductions: A LIWC analysis, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 32, (2013); Pennebaker J.W., Chung C.K., Frazee J., Lavergne G.M., Beaver D.I., When small words foretell academic success: The case of college admissions essays., PLoS ONE, 9, 12, (2014); Ramesh A., Goldwasser D., Huang B., Daume H., Getoor L., Understanding MOOC discussion forums using seeded LDA, ACL Workshop On Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pp. 22-27; Crossley S., McNamara D.S., Baker R., Wang Y., Paquette L., Barnes T., Bergner Y., Language to completion: Success in an educational data mining massive open online class, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2015); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); McCallum A.K., MALLET: A Machine Learning for Language Toolkit, (2002); Pennebaker J.W., Chung C.K., Ireland M., Gonzales A., Booth R.J., The Development and Psychometric Properties of LIWC2007, LIWC2007 Manual, (2007); Manning C.D., Surdeanu M., Bauer J., Finkel J., Bethard S.J., McClosky D., The stanford CoreNLP natural language processing toolkit, Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pp. 55-60, (2014); Witten I.H., Frank E., Hall M.A., Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, 3rd Edition, (2011); Chang C.-C., Lin C.-J., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines, ACM Transactions On Intelligent Systems and Technology, 27, pp. 21-27, (2011); Breiman L., Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048463393,,

Utilizing both a historical dataset of CIS students over a 10 year period, and a current student dataset, this analysis specifically deals with the following questions: 1. How can we use the past to predict retention risk of the future students? 2. Do students who transfer CIS courses (core or elective) have an increased retention risk?

It is crucial for universities and colleges to develop data-driven artificial intelligence systems to identify students at-risk as early as possible and provide timely guidance and support for them. However, most of the current classification approaches on early dropout prediction are unable to utilize all the information from historical data from previous cohorts to predict dropouts of current students in a few semesters. In this paper, we develop an Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) method to address the challenge of early prediction. The proposed framework is able to make full use of historical student record and effectively predict students at-risk of failing or dropping out in future semesters. Empirical results evaluated on a real-wold dataset show significant improvement with respect to the performance metrics in comparison to other existing methods. The application enabled by this proposed method provide additional support to students who are at risk of dropping out of college. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Early dropout prediction; Educational data mining; Iterative Logistic Regression,Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Regression analysis; Artificial intelligence systems; Classification approach; Educational data mining; Higher education institutions; Logistic regressions; Performance metrics; Undergraduate degrees; Universities and colleges; Students,"Agresti A., Finlay B., Statistical models for the social sciences, Revascularization Procedures after Coronary Angiography.

In this paper we describe the results of an educational data analytics case study focused on detection of dropout of System Engineering (SE) undergraduate students after 7 years of enrollment in a Colombian university. Original data is extended and enriched using a feature engineering process. Our experimental results showed that simple algorithms achieve reliable levels of accuracy to identify predictors of dropout. Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes results were compared in order to propose the best option. Also, Watson Analytics is evaluated to establish the usability of the service for a non expert user. Main results are presented in order to decrease the dropout rate by identifying potential causes. In addition, we present some findings related to data quality to improve the students data collection process. © 2018 IEEE.",educational data mining; prediction models; student desertion prediction; Student drop out,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Forecasting; Data collection process; Drop-out; Educational data mining; Educational institutions; Feature engineerings; Logistic regressions; Prediction model; Undergraduate students; Students,"Al-Radaideh Q.A., Al-Shawakfa E.M., Al-Najjar M.I., Mining student data using decision trees, International Arab Conference on Information Technology (ACIT'2006), (2006); Aulck L., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Predicting Student Dropout in Higher Education, (2016); Baradwaj B.K., Pal S., Mining Educational Data to Analyze Students' Performance, (2012); Bhardwaj B.K., Pal S., Data Mining: A Prediction for Performance Improvement Using Classification, (2012); Chapman P., Clinton J., Kerber R., Khabaza T., Reinartz T., Shearer C., Wirth R., Crisp-dm 1.0, 76, (2000); Spadies - Sistema de Prevencion y Analisis a la Desercion en Las Instituciones de Educacion Superior; Dekker G.W., Pechenizkiy M., Vleeshouwers J.M., Predicting Students Drop Out: A Case Study; Devasia T., Vinushree T.P., Hegde V., Prediction of students performance using Educational Data Mining, 2016 International Conference on Data Mining and Advanced Computing (SAPIENCE), pp. 91-95, (2016); Kabakchieva D., Predicting student performance by using data mining methods for classification, Cybernetics and Information Technologies, 13, 1, pp. 61-72, (2013); Kovacic Z., Early Prediction of Student Success: Mining Students' Enrolment Data, (2010); Marquez-Vera C., Cano A., Romero C., Noaman A.Y.M., Fardoun H.M., Ventura S., Early dropout prediction using data mining: A case study with high school students, Expert Systems, 33, 1, pp. 107-124, (2016); Mishra T., Kumar D., Gupta S., Mining students' data for prediction performance, 2014 Fourth International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Technologies, pp. 255-262, (2014); Raju D., Schumacker R., Exploring Student Characteristics of Retention That Lead to Graduation in Higher Education Using Data Mining Models, (2015); Seidman A., Retention revisited: R= e, id+ e & in, IV, College and University, 71, 4, pp. 18-20, (1996); Tekin A., Early prediction of students' grade point averages at graduation: A data mining approach, Eurasian Journal of Educational Research, 54, pp. 207-226, (2014); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, 1, pp. 89-125, (1975); Yukselturk E., Ozekes S., Kilic Turel Y., Predicting dropout student: An application of data mining methods in an online education program, European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning, 17, 1, pp. 118-133, (2014)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056464033,,

The experiments revealed that the main factor that influences student retention in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) is the cumulative grade point average (GPA). The linear smoothing of the data helped remove the noise spikes in data thereby improving the retention results. The data is decomposed into Haar coefficients that helped accurate classification. The results showed that the HBCU undergraduate student retention corresponds to an average GPA of 2.8597 and the difference of -0.023307.

The study will compare the performance and efficiency of ensemble techniques that make use of different combination of data sources with that of base classifiers with single data source. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative research methodology, data samples of 141 learners enrolled in the University of the West of Scotland were extracted from the institution’s databases and also collected through survey questionnaire. The research focused on three data sources: student record system, learning management system and survey, and also used three state-of-art data mining classifiers, namely, decision tree, artificial neural network and support vector machine for the modeling. In addition, the ensembles of these base classifiers were used in the student performance prediction and the performances of the seven different models developed were compared using six different evaluation metrics. Findings: The results show that the approach of using multiple data sources along with heterogeneous ensemble techniques is very efficient and accurate in prediction of student performance as well as help in proper identification of student at risk of attrition. Practical implications: The approach proposed in this study will help the educational administrators and policy makers working within educational sector in the development of new policies and curriculum on higher education that are relevant to student retention. In addition, the general implications of this research to practice is its ability to accurately help in early identification of students at risk of dropping out of HE from the combination of data sources so that necessary support and intervention can be provided. Originality/value: The research empirically investigated and compared the performance accuracy and efficiency of single classifiers and ensemble of classifiers that make use of single and multiple data sources. The study has developed a novel hybrid model that can be used for predicting student performance that is high in accuracy and efficient in performance. Generally, this research study advances the understanding of the application of ensemble techniques to predicting student performance using learner data and has successfully addressed these fundamental questions: What combination of variables will accurately predict student academic performance? What is the potential of the use of stacking ensemble techniques in accurately predicting student academic performance? © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",ANN; DT; Education data mining; Ensemble model; Higher education; Learners’ performance; Performance prediction; SVM,,"Adejo O., Connolly T., An integrated system framework for predicting students’ academic performance in higher educational institutions, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology (IJCSIT), 9, 3, pp. 149-157, (2017); Agudo-Peregrina A.F., Iglesias-Pradas S., Conde-Gonzalez M.A., Hernandez-Garcia A., Can we predict success from log data in VLEs?

The computational model emphasizes and operationalizes distinct modes of social learning, differentiated in terms of socialization opportunities. Simulation results demonstrate that computational models based on fundamental principles of social learning provide a robust approach to study task coordination in teams and can be used to explore ways to organize opportunities for social learning depending upon member retention, team structure, and the complexity of the design task.

However, most prior studies were based solely on a specific modeling method of authors' choice. Direct comparison of competing methods using identical collection of student retention data was rarely provided. The purpose of this paper is to present a direct comparison of prominent methods for modeling student retention using the same data. Four modeling methodologies (neural networks, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and structural equation modeling) are included in this study. These competing methods were implemented on five retention models with various collections of cognitive and non-cognitive factors, ranging from 9 to 71 variables. The retention data in this study were collected from more than 1500 first year engineering students in a large Midwestern university. The eleven cognitive attributes include high school GPAs, standardized test scores, and the grades and number of semesters in math, science and English courses in high school. The non-cognitive variables were collected through Student Attitudinal Success Instrument (SASI), covering the following nine constructs: Leadership, Deep Learning, Surface Learning, Teamwork, Academic Self-efficacy, Motivation, Metacognition, Expectancy-value, and Major Decision. The following findings are found during this study. First, among the five retention models, the two hybrid models with both cognitive and non-cognitive factors always perform better than models consisting of either only cognitive, or only non-cognitive factors. Second, the addition of non-cognitive items can significantly improve the prediction performance of a cognitive-only model when applied properly. Third, neural network methods perform better than the other three methodologies in performance indices, followed by logistic regression. However, logistic regression may be attractive to some researchers for its ease in implementation and lower requirements for computation power. Finally, the authors found the commonly used threshold (0.05) for including variables in stepwise selection process in logistic regression may not result in the best model for prediction performance. The authors strongly suggest that researchers explore beyond this typical threshold in order to find the best performing collection of variables. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.",,Computation theory; Discriminant analysis; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Students; Academic self-efficacy; First-year engineering; Logistic regressions; Modeling methodology; Neural network method; Performance indices; Prediction performance; Structural equation modeling; Regression analysis,"Augustine N., Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for A Brighter Economic Future, (2005); Beaufait F.W., Engineering Education Needs Surgery, (1991); Astin A.W., Engineering outcomes, ASEE Prism, pp. 27-30, (1993); Imbrie P.K., Lin J.J., Malyscheff A., Artificial intelligence methods to forecast engineering students' retention based on cognitive and non-cognitive factors, Annual Conference of American Society for Engineering Education, (2008); Immekus J.C., Maller S.J., Imbrie P.K., Wu N., McDermott P.A., Work in Progress- An Analysis of Students' Academic Success and Persistence Using Pre-college Factors, (2005); Reid K.J., Development of the Student Attitudinal Success Instrument: Assessment of First-year Engineering Students including Differences by Gender, (2009); Levin J., Wycokoff J., Predicting persistence and success in baccalaurate engineering, Education, 111, 4, pp. 461-468, (1991); House J., The relationship between academic self-concept and school withdrawal, Journal of Social Psychology, 133, pp. 125-127, (1993); Schaeffers K.G., Epperson D.L., Nauta M.M., Women's career development: Can theoretically derived variables predict persistence in engineering majors?, Journal of Counseling Psychology, 44, pp. 173-183, (1997); Besterfield-Sacre M., Atman C.J., Shuman L.J., Characteristics of freshman engineering students: Models for determining student attrition in engineering, Journal of Engineering Education, 86, 2, pp. 139-149, (1997); Zhang Z., RiCharde R.S., Prediction and analysis of freshman retention, Annual Forum of the Association for Institutional Research (AIR), (1998); Besterfield-Sacre M., Shuman L., Wolfe H., Scalise A., Larpkiattaworn S., Muogboh O.S., Et al., Modeling for educational enhancement and assessment, Annual Conference of American Society for Engineering Education, (2002); French B.F., Immekus J.C., Oakes W.C., An examination of indicators of engineering students' success and persistence, Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 419-425, (2005); Schaeffers K.G., Epperson D.L., Nauta M.M., Women's career development: Can theoretically derived variables predict persistence in engineering majors?, Journal of Counseling Psychology, 44, pp. 173-183, (1997); Pascarella E.T., Terenzini P.T., Predicting voluntary freshman year persistence/withdrawal behavior in a residential university: A path analytic validation of Tinto's model, Journal of Educational Psychology, 75, 2, pp. 215-226, (1983); Fuertes J., Sedlacek W., Using the SAT and noncognitive variables to predict the grades and retention of Asian American university students, Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling & Development, 27, pp. 74-84, (1994); Burtner J., The use of discriminant analysis to investigate the influence of non-cognitive factors on engineering school persistence, Journal of Engineering Education, (2005); Aitken N.D., College student performance, satisfaction and retention: Specification and estimation of a structural model, Journal of Higher Education, 53, 1, pp. 32-50, (1982); Nora A., Attinasi L.C., Matonak A., Testing qualitative indicators of precollege factors in Tinto's attrition model: A community college student population, Review of Higher Education, 13, 3, (1990); Cabrera A., Nora A., Castaneda M., College persistence: Structural equation modeling test of an integrated model of student retention, Journal of Higher Education, 64, pp. 123-129, (1993); French B.F., Immekus J.C., Oakes W., A structural model of engineering students success and persistence, Frontiers in Education, (2003); Smith K.A., Gupta J.N.D., Neural Networks in Business: Techniques and Applications, (2002); Tsoukalas L.H., Uhrig R.E., Fuzzy and Neural Approaches in Engineering, (1997); Coit D.W., Jackson B.T., Smith A.E., Static neural network process models: Considerations and case studies, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 11, pp. 2953-2967, (1998); Hastie T., Tibshirani R., Friedman J., The Elements of Statistical Learning- Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, (2009)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029025113,,

However, all students do not finish their master thesis. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the non-completion of the master thesis should be viewed as a substantial problem that requires serious attention and proactive planning. This learning analytics study aims to understand better factors that influence completion and non-completion of master thesis projects. More specifically, we ask: which student and supervisor factors influence completion and non-completion of master thesis? Can we predict completion and non-completion of master thesis using such variables in order to optimise the matching of supervisors and students? To answer the research questions, we extracted data about supervisors and students from two thesis management systems which record large amounts of data related to the thesis process. The sample used was 755 master thesis projects supervised by 109 teachers. By applying traditional statistical methods (descriptive statistics, correlation tests and independent sample t-tests), as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify five central factors that can accurately predict master thesis completion and non-completion. Besides the identified predictors that explain master thesis completion and non-completion, this study contributes to demonstrating how educational data and learning analytics can produce actionable data-driven insights. In this case, insights that can be utilised to inform and optimise how supervisors and students are matched and to stimulate targeted training and capacity building of supervisors. © 2019, The Author(s).",Completion; Dropout; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Master; Retention; Thesis,Engineering education; Information management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Personnel training; Students; Supervisory personnel; Well completion; Dropout; Learning analytics; Master; Retention; Thesis; Machine learning,"Kamler B., Thomson P., The failure of dissertation advice books: Toward alternative pedagogies for doctoral writing, Educ.

Ideally, early indicators of student progress, or lack thereof, can be used to provide appropriate interventions that increase the likelihood of student success. In this paper we present a framework that uses data mining and machine learning techniques, and in particular, linear regression and a Markov network (MN), to predict the performance of students early in their academic careers. The results obtained show that the proposed framework can predict student progress, specifically student grade point average (GPA) within the intended major, with minimal error after observing a single semester of performance. Furthermore, as additional performance is observed, the predicted GPA in subsequent semesters becomes increasingly accurate, providing the ability to advise students regarding likely success outcomes early in their academic careers. © 2014 IEEE.",educational analytics; linear regression; Markov Network; student success,Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Data mining; Education; Forecasting; Learning systems; Linear regression; Markov processes; Colleges and universities; Early indicators; educational analytics; Machine learning techniques; Markov networks; Student performance; Student progress; Student success; Students,"Performance Funding for Higher Education, (2012); Venezia A., Callan P.M., Finney J.E., Kirst M.W., Usdan M.D., The governance divide: A report on a four-state study on improving college readiness and success, The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, (2005); Zhang L., Does state funding affect graduation rates at public fouryear colleges and universities?, Educational Policy, 23, 5, pp. 714-731, (2009); Educational Attainment in the United States, (2012); Wigdahl J., Heileman G.L., Slim A., Abdallah C.T., Curricular efficiency: What role does it play in student success?, Proceedings of the the 121st ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, (2014); Slim A., Kozlick J., Heileman G.L., Wigdahl J., Abdallah C.T., Network analysis of university courses, Proceedings of the 6th Annual Workshop on Simplifying Complex Networks for Practitioners, (2014); Slim A., Kozlick J., Heileman G.L., Wigdahl J., Abdallah C.T., The complexity of university curricula according to course cruciality, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, (2014); Schmidt U., Learning and Evaluating Markov Random Fields for Natural Images; Roth S., High-order Markov Random Fields for Low-level Vision, (2007); Hoffmann J.P., Linear Regression Analysis: Applications and Assumptions, (2010); Chamillard A.T., Using student performance predictions in a computer science curriculum, ITICSE 06: Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, pp. 260-264, (2006); Deckro R.F., Woundenberg H.W., Mba Admission Criteria and Academic Success, 8, 4, pp. 765-769, (1977); Deckro R.F., Woundenberg H.W., Identifying Factors That Influence Performance of Non-computing Majors in the Business Computer Information Systems Course, 21, 4, pp. 431-446, (1989); Butcher D.F., Muth W.A., Predicting performance in an introductory computer science course, Commun ACM, 28, 3, pp. 263-268, (1985); Ting S.-M.R., Robinson T.L., First-year academic success: A prediction combining cognitive and psychosocial variables for caucasian and african american students, Journal of College Student Development, (1998); Bennedsen J., Caspersen M.E., Optimists Have More Fun, but Do They Learn Better? : On the Influence of Emotional and Social Factors on Learning Cs and Math, 18, 1, pp. 1-16, (2008); Keen K.J., Etzkorn L., Predicting students grades in computer science courses based on complexity measures of teachers lecture notes, J.

It permeates the several levels and teaching modalities and has generated social, economic, political, academic and financial damage to all involved in the educational process. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop efficient methods for prediction of the students at risk of dropping out, enabling the adoption of proactive actions to minimize the situation. Thus, this work aims to present the potentialities of an intelligent system developed for the prediction of the group of students at risk of dropping out in higher education classroom courses. The system was developed using a Fuzzy-ARTMAP Neural Network, one of the artificial intelligence techniques, which makes the continued learning of the system possible. This research was developed in the technology courses of the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso, based on the academic and socioeconomic records of the students. The results, showing a success rate of the dropout group around 92% and overall accuracy over 85%, highlights the reliability and accuracy of the system. It is highlighted that the strength and boldness of this research lies in the possibility of identifying early the eminent school dropout using only the enrollment data. © 2013 IEEE.",Dropout prediction; Fuzzy-ARTMAP neural network; Higher education; Intelligent system; Proactivity,Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Neural networks; Teaching; Tools; Artificial intelligence techniques; Educational process; Fuzzy-Artmap Neural Network; Higher education; Mato Grosso; Overall accuracies; Pro activities; Risk groups; Students,"Martinho V., Intelligent system for prediction of group risk evasion student, PhD in Electrical Engineering PosGraduate Program in Electrical Engineering, (2012); Lobo M.B.M., Overview of the evasion in brazilian higher education: General causes and solutions, ABMES Magazine, 25; Berger J.B., Ramirez G.B., Lyons S., Past to present: A historical look at retention, College Student Retention: Formula for Student Success, pp. 1-30, (2012); Evasion or Retention A Crucial Question the Sustainability of Higher Education Institutions, 86; Ministry of education and culture, Special Committee for the Study of Evasion in the Brazilian Public Universities: Graduation, Retention and Evasion in Undergraduate Institutions of Public Higher Education, (1997); Higher Education Census: 2011-technical Summary, (2013); Barbosa J.O., Identification and analysis of the prevalent and determinant factors of school sropout in the higher education course of technology in industrial automation of the ifmt 2004-2010, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Mato Grosso-IFMT, Internal Report, Cuiab:IFMT, (2011); Informe Sobre la Educaci N Superior en Amrica Latina y El Caribe 2000-2005: La Metamorfosis de la Educacin Superior, (2006); Haykin S.S., Neural Networks and Learning Machines, (2009); Nilsson N.J., Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis, (1998); Lykourentzou I., Giannoukos I., Nikolopoulos V., Mpardis G., Loumos V., Dropout prediction in e-learning courses through the combination of machine learning techniques, Journal Computers & Education, 53, pp. 950-965, (2009); Mustafa L.M.N.C., Kamal S., Students dropout prediction for intelligent system from tertiary level in developing country, International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision-ICIEV12, (2012); Zadeh L.A., Fuzzy sets, Information and Control, 8, pp. 338-353, (1965); Barnett J.A., Computational methods for a mathematical theory of evidence, Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing: Classic Works of the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Belief Functions, pp. 197-216, (2008); Carpenter G.A., Grossberg S., A self-organizing neural network for supervised learning, recognition, and prediction, Communications Magazine, 30, pp. 38-49, (1992); Carpenter G.A., Grossberg S., Markuzon N., Reynolds J.H., Rosen D.B., Fuzzy artmap: A neural network architecture for incremental supervised learning of analog multidimensional maps, Neural Networks IEEE Transactions on, 3, pp. 698-713, (1992); Carpenter G.A., Grossberg S., Iizuka K., Comparative performance measures of fuzzy ARTMAP, learned vector quantization, and back propagation for handwritten character recognition, International Joint Conference on Neural Networks-IJCNN, 1, pp. 794-799, (1992); Carpenter G.A., Grossberg S., Reynolds J.H., Artmap: Supervised real-time learning and classification of nonstationary data by a self-organizing neural network, Neural Network., 4, pp. 565-588, (1991); Marchiori S.C., Da Silveira M.C.G., Lotufo A.D.P., Minussi C.R., Lopes M.L.M., Neural network based on adaptive resonance theory with continuous training for multi-configuration transient stability analysis of electric power systems, Applied Soft Computing, 11, pp. 706-715, (2011); Carpenter G.A., Grossberg S., A massively parallel architecture for a self-organizing neural pattern recognition machine, Computing Vision Graph.

Active learning is one of the latest teaching techniques that engage students in the learning procedure. While active learning has become an axiom in STEM education, overwhelming research in active learning demonstrates its effectiveness in promoting student engagement, learning, motivation and retention. It has been observed, that the active learning techniques have been one of the vital tools for instructors to stimulate student engagement. In short, active learning is any activity that engages students in a classroom, and demands students to do significant learning activities and analyze what they are doing, rather than simply focusing on traditional lecture. Student engagement in classroom via review, discussion, application and practice, demonstrated that the students learn more than in traditional classrooms. In-class reading and writing exercises also, improve student engagement in learning process even in large size classes. To improve student engagement in the class size of up to 40, in senior mechanical engineering courses, such as machine design. Every student was provided with similar problem having different variables to solve. The instructor was solving a similar problem on whiteboard with dissimilar variables than students. This demands for active discussion with their peers, teams and with the instructor kept the whole class engaged.

It also advocated the wider adoption of ""active-learning approaches, including project and problem-based learning'. Over the past four years, Victoria University has been working towards a problem based learning (PBL) approach that is designed to address challenges such as these in a way that reflects both our students and our setting. The majority of our students have just completed secondary school, often with modest grades. Many are the first in their family to attend university, are typically from homes where a language other than English is spoken and come from areas with a relatively low average income. Most need to work part-time while studying to support themselves. Despite these impediments, many complete the course successfully but at least an equal number do not. We are therefore currently undertaking a review of our engineering courses that focuses, amongst other things, on improving the academic success of our students.

However, the time required to review the collection and make weeding decisions presents a formidable obstacle. This study empirically evaluated methods for automatically classifying weeding candidates. A data set containing 80,346 items from a large-scale weeding project running from 2011 to 2014 at Wesleyan University was used to train six machine learning classifiers to predict a weeding decision of either ‘Keep’ or ‘Weed’ for each candidate. The study found statistically significant agreement (p = 0.001) between classifier predictions and librarian judgments for all classifier types. The naive Bayes and linear support vector machine classifiers had the highest recall (fraction of items weeded by librarians that were identified by the algorithm), while the k-nearest-neighbor classifier had the highest precision (fraction of recommended candidates that librarians had chosen to weed). The variables found to be most relevant were: librarian and faculty votes for retention, item age, and the presence of copies in other libraries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Agee A., Faculty response to deselection in academic libraries: A psycholinguistic analysis, Collection Management, 42, 2, pp. 59-75, (2017); Breiman L., Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Cohn D.A., Ghahramani Z., Jordan M.I., Active learning with statistical models, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 4, pp. 129-145, (1996); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Cover T., Hart P., Nearest neighbor pattern classification, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 13, 1, pp. 21-27, (1967); Crosetto A., Kinner L., Duhon L., Assessment in a tight time frame: Using readily available data to evaluate your collection, Collection Management, 33, 1-2, pp. 29-50, (2008); Dilevko J., Gottlieb L., Weed to achieve: A fundamental part of the public library mission?, Library Collections, Acquisitions, and Technical Services, 27, pp. 73-96, (2003); Dubicki E., Weeding: Facing the fears, Collection Building, 27, 4, pp. 132-135, (2008); Duda R.O., Hart P.E., Pattern classification and scene analysis, (1973); Goldstein C.H., A study of weeding policies in eleven TALON resource libraries, Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 69, 3, pp. 311-316, (1981); Kent A., Cohen J., Montgomery K.L., Williams J.G., Bulick S., Flynn R.R., Mansfield U., Use of library materials: The University of Pittsburgh study, (1979); Larson J., CREW: A weeding manual for modern libraries, (2012); Lugg R., Data-driven deselection for monographs: A rules-based approach to weeding, storage, and shared print decisions, Insight, 25, 2, pp. 198-204, (2012); McAllister A.D., Scherlen A., Weeding with wisdom: Tuning deselection of print monographs in book-reliant disciplines, Collection Management, 42, 2, pp. 76-91, (2017); McHale C., Egger-Sider F., Fluk L., Ovadia S., Weeding without walking: A mediated approach to list-based deselection, Collection Management, 42, 2, pp. 91-108, (2017); Metz P., Gray C., Public relations and library weeding, The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 31, 3, pp. 273-279, (2005); Mitchell T.M., Machine learning, (1997); Moore C., Core collection development in a medium-sized public library, Library Resources & Technical Services, 26, 1, pp. 37-46, (1982); Quinlan J.R., Induction of decision trees, Machine Learning, 1, 1, pp. 81-106, (1986); Roy L., An investigation of the use of weeding and displays as methods to increase the stock turnover rate in small public libraries, (1987); Selth J., Koller N., Briscoe P., The use of books within the library, College & Research Libraries, 53, 3, pp. 197-205, (1992); Silverstein C., Shieber S.M., Predicting individual book use for off-site storage using decision trees, The Library Quarterly, 66, 3, (1996); Slote S.J., Weeding library collections: Library weeding methods, (1997); Snyder C.E., Data-driven deselection: Multiple point data using a decision support tool in an academic library, Collection Management, 39, 1, pp. 17-31, (2014); Soma A.K., Sjoberg L.M., More than just low-hanging fruit: A collaborative approach to weeding in academic libraries, Collection Management, 36, 1, pp. 17-28, (2010); Trueswell R.W., Determining the optimal number of volumes for a library's core collection, Libri, 16, pp. 49-60, (1966); Tully P., More than you want to know about weeding criteria, (2011); Tully P., Update: April 10, 2012, (2012); Tully P., Project wrap-up - July 31, 2014, (2014); Yule G.U., On the association of attributes in statistics, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, 75, pp. 257-319, (1900); Yule G.U., On the methods of measuring association between two attributes, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 49, 6, pp. 579-652, (1912); Zuber P., Weeding the collection: An analysis of motivations, methods and metrics, Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference (pp. 6139–6152).

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique that has been proven to be efficient for this purpose. However, to avoid overloading the surgeon during the operation, automatic cancer detection at the surface of the removed tissue is needed. This work explores automated margin assessment on a sample of patient data collected at the Pathology Department, Severance Hospital (Seoul, South Korea). Some methods based on the spatial statistics of the images have been developed, but the obtained results are still far from human performance. In this work, we investigate the possibility to use deep neural networks (DNNs) for real time margin assessment, demonstrating performance significantly better than the reported literature and close to the level of a human expert. Since the goal is to detect the presence of cancer, a patch-based classification method is proposed, as it is sufficient for detection, and requires training data that is easier and cheaper to collect than for other approaches such as segmentation. For that purpose, we train a DNN architecture that was proved to be efficient for small images on patches extracted from images containing only cancer or only normal tissue as determined by pathologists in a university hospital. As the number of available images in all such studies is by necessity small relative to other deep network applications such as ImageNet, a good regularization method is needed. In this work, we propose to use a recently introduced function norm regularization that attempts to directly control the function complexity, in contrast to classical approaches such as weight decay and DropOut. As neither the code nor the data of previous results are publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results are the average over the different trials. The experimental results show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization yielded higher and more robust results than competing regularization methods. We have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced from approximately 12% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5% – a 58% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative application (less than 2 s per image) at the only cost of a longer offline training time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Breast cancer; Deep Neural Network (DNN); Function norm; Margin assessment; Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT); Regularization,"Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Margins of Excision; Nerve Net; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Classification (of information); Diseases; Dynamic loads; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Medical imaging; Optical tomography; Tissue; Transplantation (surgical); Breast Cancer; Classification methods; Correlation coefficient; Intra-operative applications; Margin assessment; Regularization; Regularization methods; Seoul , South Korea; Article; breast tissue; cancer diagnosis; correlation coefficient; data analysis; deep neural network; error; human; human tissue; intraoperative period; lumpectomy; machine learning; optical coherence tomography; pathologist; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; surgical margin; university hospital; algorithm; breast tumor; female; image enhancement; nerve cell network; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; Deep neural networks","American Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Key Statistics 2017., (2017); American Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2015–2016, (2015); Boser B.E., Guyon I.M., Vapnik V.N., A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, ACM, pp. 144-152, (1992); Chen T.C., Cense B., Pierce M.C., Nassif N., Park B.H., Yun S.H., White B.R., Bouma B.E., Tearney G.J., de Boer J.F., Spectral domain optical coherence tomography: ultra-high speed, ultra-high resolution ophthalmic imaging, Arch.

Research shows that student performance and persistence in a STEM degree is associated primarily with three aspects of their experience: intellectual engagement and achievement, motivation (e.g., having role models), and identification with a STEM field (e.g., developing meaningful relationships, being part of the community). While there is a large body of work about pedagogies and strategies that address these needs (e.g., active learning, experiential learning, service learning, flipped classrooms, etc.), the majority of university instructors are slow to adopt new teaching strategies. Most STEM faculty were never trained to be teachers, and there are many well documented reasons that faculty are slow to change teaching habits (e.g., (Frederick 1986). According to Sarason and Banbury (2004), ""many faculty accept the premises of active learning but do not have adequate tools to bring active learning techniques into the classroom."" Games and game-based learning have been used in many classrooms as an active learning strategy. Game-based learning is a well-documented method to engage and motivate students with course material in order to improve student-learning outcomes. One very successful and popular game is Clarkson University's Energy Choices board game. This award-winning board game teaches concepts of energy; research shows that when game play was integrated into the curriculum, this game was shown to increase desired cognitive (e.g., documented improvements to math and science achievement scores) and affective (e.g., student interest and confidence in STEM) outcomes. In addition, the Energy Choices board game is widespread. Using Energy Choices as inspiration, we are developing a framework for integrating game design into civil engineering and construction management curriculum that makes it easier to develop and publish games like Energy Choices. We are developing a set of game design approaches for use in the classroom that promote high levels of student engagement, create a sense of community, improve student metacognition, increase student retention in STEM, all the while being easily transferable and scalable. By involving students in game play and game design, we not only better engage students, we also create community and drive students to higher levels of metacognition. We have also found that following game play with game design easily moves students up the cognitive dimension of Bloom's taxonomy, from merely understanding, to reflection, creation, and evaluation. Board games and role-playing games are formats that create community; students interact with one another over intellectual, enjoyable, and memorable shared experiences. When the co-authors play board games in their classrooms, they note 100% of students in class that day engage in game play - anecdotally, this activity seems to engage more students than other types of active learning strategies. And finally, board games and role-playing games are an ideal format because any faculty or student can easily modify them. This poster presents our project results to date and provides recommendations and resources to adopt game design in civil engineering and construction courses nationwide. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Learning systems; Project management; Students; Teaching; Active learning strategies; Cognitive dimensions; Construction management; Experiential learning; Game-based Learning; Science , technology , engineering , and maths; Student learning outcomes; Student performance; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)","Allen D., Murphy C., Allenby B., Davidson C., Sustainable engineering: A model for engineering education in the twenty-first century?, Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy, 8, 2, pp. 70-71, (2006); Auchey F.L., Mills T.H., Beliveau Y.J., Auchey G.J., Using the learning outcomes template as an effective tool for evaluation of the undergraduate building construction program, Journal of Construction Education, 5, 3, pp. 244-259, (2000); Berland M., Lee V.R., Collaborative strategic board games as a site for distributed computational thinking, Developments in Current Game-Based Learning Design and Deployment, 285, (2012); Chan E.H., Chan M., Scott D., Chan A.T., Educating the 21st century construction professionals, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 128, 1, pp. 44-51, (2002); Chen S., Michael D., Proof of Learning: Assessment in Serious Games, (2005); Dewoolkar M.M., George L., Hayden N.J., Neumann M., Hands-on undergraduate geotechnical engineering modules in the context of effective learning pedagogies, ABET outcomes, and our curricular reform, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 135, 4, pp. 161-175, (2009); Eagle M., Barnes T., Experimental evaluation of an educational game for improved learning in introductory computing, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 41, 1, pp. 321-325, (2009); Frederick P.J., The lively lecture - 8 variations, College Teaching, 34, 2, pp. 43-50, (1986); Gros B., Digital games in education: The design of games-based learning environments, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 40, 1, pp. 23-38, (2007); Prensky M., Digital game-based learning, Computers in Entertainment (CIE), 1, 1, (2003); Sarason Y., Banbury C., Active learning facilitated by using a game-show format or who doesn't want to be a millionaire?, Journal of Management Education, 28, 4, pp. 509-518, (2004); Savage R.N., Chen K.C., Vanasupa L., Integrating project-based learning throughout the undergraduate engineering curriculum, Materials Engineering, 1, (2007); Williamson D., Squire K., Halverson R., Gee J., Video games and the future of learning, Phi Delta Kappan, 87, 2, pp. 104-111, (2005)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030552981,,

This doctoral project builds upon current data mining and modeling, machine learning applications, and learning analytics for predicting student success that is beyond retention. Gaining knowledge of CS student learning, developing better alerting models for success, and discovering behavioral indicators from learning analytics reporting is the goal of this research. Using this knowledge as evidence based data for improving the CS student experience will aid in performance improvements and increase pathways to graduation.

Schematic simulations that are more abstract, with less visual fidelity but make system structure and function transparent, may enhance deeper learning and optimize retention and transfer of learning. We compared learning effectiveness of these 2 modes of externalizing the output of a common simulation engine (the Virtual Anesthesia Machine, VAM) that models machine function and dynamics and responds in real time to user interventions such as changes in gas flow or ventilation. METHODS: Undergraduate students (n ≤ 39) and medical students (n ≤ 35) were given a single, 1-hour guided learning session with either a Transparent or an Opaque version of the VAM simulation. The following day, the learners' knowledge of machine components, function, and dynamics was tested. RESULTS: The Transparent-VAM groups scored higher than the Opaque-VAM groups on a set of multiple-choice questions concerning conceptual knowledge about anesthesia machines (P ≤ 0.009), provided better and more complete explanations of component function (P ≤ 0.003), and were more accurate in remembering and inferring cause-and-effect dynamics of the machine and relations among components (P ≤ 0.003). Although the medical students outperformed undergraduates on all measures, a similar pattern of benefits for the Transparent VAM was observed for these 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Schematic simulations that transparently allow learners to visualize, and explore, underlying system dynamics and relations among components may provide a more effective mental model for certain systems. This may lead to a deeper understanding of how the system works, and therefore, we believe, how to detect and respond to potentially adverse situations.

It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This pedagogical requirement is important because graduates are expected to develop software that meets rigorous quality standards in functional and application domains with little to no training. Lack of effective active tools has been addressed by the authors by designing, developing, and delivering, twenty (20) delivery hours of Case Studies, sixteen (16) delivery hours of Class Exercises, and six (6) delivery hours of Video Case Studies for use in courses that impart knowledge on SV&V topics viz. requirements engineering, software reviews, configuration management, and software testing. Four key skill areas sought after by employers, namely communication skills, applied knowledge of methods, applied knowledge of tools, and research exposure have been used to drive the development funded by a National Science Foundation grant and perfected through an industry-academia partnership. These tools have been successfully disseminated to over 25 universities with many CS, IS, SE programs incorporating the tools in their existing courses and others designing new courses based on these tools. Since student learning retention depends on knowledge retention activities delivered in different settings it is important to identify and incorporate delivery strategies that meet course and/or module learning outcomes. In this paper we discuss strategies used to effectively incorporate and deliver the developed Active Learning tools by instructors at two universities. Traditional and flipped classroom delivery strategies are discussed as well as topics like pre-requisite knowledge preparation prior to class, course module presentation sequence, homework, team/individual work, collaborative discussions, and assessment tools are deliberated. In addition student feedback and assessment are also presented for each category of active learning tools and strategies that work are summarized. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Computer software selection and evaluation; Curricula; Engineering education; Personnel training; Software testing; Teaching; Verification; Communication skills; Configuration management; Knowledge retention; National Science Foundations; Quality standard; Real-world experience; Software verification; Student learning; Education,"Teaching Strategies; Promoting Active Learning; Prince M., Does active learning work?
